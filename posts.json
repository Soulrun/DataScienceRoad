She has always called the sea her home, so she\u2019s also a fast swimmer who\u2019s able to remain underwater longer than any character in Black Desert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But what about her secondary weapon, you ask? Well, here\u2019s the twist. Meet Mareca! Corsair\u2019s magical seafaring orb grants her the powers of the ocean itself.

We\u2019ve doubled frame rate from 30 to 60 FPS, and quadrupled resolution to 4K, while completely overhauling our engine to deliver a fully ray-traced lighting experience that offers unprecedented realism; we\u2019ve leveraged the lightning fast SSD to reduce loading times; and we support 3D Audio to further increase player immersion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In this article, we\u2019ll talk in more detail about our support for the DualSense wireless controller, and how these innovative new hardware features allow us to push player immersion even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As you may have guessed, creating that sense of immersion is one of our key goals for the Metro series. We\u2019ve been refining our craft over the past decade, using narrative, audio, and visual tricks to draw players deeper into the game world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"DS 4A MEX DUALSENSE BROLL CLIPS (2)\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/legalsafejapanesebeetle#?secret=4cRCa2xjdz' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">A big focus has been how the player character, Artyom, feels connected to and embedded within the game world \u2013 we strip away the HUD \/ UI to the bare minimum, try and physicalize as much information to break down the barriers between the players eyes and the world; and we put a huge amount of effort into our first person animations, from complex weapon reloads to physical interactions with the environment such as opening doors and manipulating or picking up objects to make the world feel tactile and alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"DS 4A MEX DUALSENSE BROLL CLIPS (5)\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/frigidfocusedarchaeopteryx#?secret=O4wvIBvQUF' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The DualSense controller has allowed us to push that tactile feel even further. The advanced haptic feedback gives each weapon a unique feel upon discharge, recoil, reload, or jam. Players will even feel the subtle differences within the same weapon class as they adapt and customise on the fly using our in-the-field crafting and customisation mechanics; adding a heavier stock to increase stability, or a suppressor to reduce muzzle climb all change how the controller responds in the player\u2019s hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"DS 4A MEX DUALSENSE BROLL CLIPS (4)\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/fastfortunatearabianwildcat#?secret=C8wmI6WAdE' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Some of Metro\u2019s signature weapons are the hand-crafted, pneumatic Tikhar and the spring loaded Helsing, and we found the perfect use for the DualSense controller\u2019s adaptive triggers to simulate the increased pressure or resistance when priming \/charging these unique firearms. Maintaining high air pressure in the tank is essential to preserve the Tikhar\u2019s lethality, and this has to be manually topped up by pumping the right trigger; as the pressure increases, so does the resistance on the trigger action so players can feel when maximum pressure has been attained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also use the adaptive triggers to mimic resistance when rowing, operating some machinery, or driving Metro\u2019s all terrain vehicle acquired in the Caspian desert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Of course, for Metro Exodus we retrofitted this new functionality into our existing design, but as creatives we\u2019re excited about exploring new gameplay mechanics that can be enhanced with the DualSense controller in mind from the start to better deliver our goal of complete player immersion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Thanks for reading, and we hope you enjoy experiencing Metro Exodus with the added immersion of the DualSense controller when it hits PS5 June 18.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Friday, our long-awaited PlayStation 5 upgrade for Metro Exodus goes live, as a free update to all current owners of the PS4 version, or available to purchase on disc as the Complete Edition for newcomers.

On the PS5, the 4K visuals really bring out all the wonderful detail our art team put into the hand-painted characters and environments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also take advantage of the DualSense controller\u2019s immersive haptic feedback in certain cases, such as when you go to pet the notorious hound of hell, Cerberus. It\u2019s a fine way of cheering yourself up a bit between escape attempts, and you\u2019ll practically feel his breath as you pet him (especially if you keep the trigger held!). Also, later in the game, you\u2019ll gain the ability to summon aid from certain companions, and the quick, high-intensity pulses on the Left Trigger will reassure you help is immediately on the way. Both the PS4 and PS5 versions of Hades also feature little details with the controller\u2019s light bar, which will match the color scheme of any Olympian god you\u2019re interacting with. Plus, there are 50 Trophies waiting to be unlocked, including a shiny Platinum if you can get all the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Pet\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/distantgaseousarcticduck#?secret=NdFo9xAiJo' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I also wanted to mention that, in addition to the digital versions slated for August 13, physical editions published by&nbsp;Private Division&nbsp;will be available at launch. These new boxed versions of Hades include a complimentary download code for the Hades Original Soundtrack, featuring two and a half hours of blood-pumping music by Darren Korb, and a 32-page full-color character compendium booklet with artwork from the game by Jen Zee. The first pressing of these versions also features a unique foil cover! Note that both the retail and digital PlayStation 4 versions of Hades<em> <\/em>include a free upgrade to the digital PlayStation 5 version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We really appreciate your interest and patience as we put the finishing touches on Hades before it launches on PlayStation. Our small team put everything we had into this game, and we\u2019ve focused on making sure these new versions for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 look and feel terrific on each console. We love hearing from both new and returning players, so do let us know what you think if you get a chance to give Hades a shot!

The feature is supported in PS5 games like Astro\u2019s Playroom, Maquette, Oddworld: Soulstorm, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart which just launched today, just to name a few.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Many of you may be curious about how the feature came to life, so we wanted to share some insights about this PlayStation Plus* member benefit that\u2019s available for supported games.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Also, check out this Game Help video demonstration from Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"xzBMr-QlzIE\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/xzBMr-QlzIE\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"A closer look at PS5\u2019s Game Help feature\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">How Game Help got started<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">During PS5 development, our research found that the majority of players told us they seek out help for their games. Almost half get stuck in a game on a weekly basis, and more than half said they encounter spoilers when they seek out help for a game, or spend too much time searching for the tip they are looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">This feedback really resonated with us, so we went to work to create a feature for players that provides them with an easy way to get hints on the specific parts of the game they are playing, without spoilers or spending a lot of time searching for tips on the internet. We worked closely with game developers to create this feature, and also incorporated key feedback from our user testing research. It\u2019s great to see this feature implemented in supported games, to quickly provide hints to players directly from the PS5 console, so they can spend more time playing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart - Solving puzzles\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/breakablealivejerboa#?secret=tcD3kh9wVr' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Use Game Help to help Clank through a tricky puzzle<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">What players are using Game Help for<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We\u2019re seeing a lot of players seeking hints on puzzles. We tend to see more engagement with Game Help for games that include a lot of puzzles throughout, like Astro\u2019s Playroom and Maquette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also see players seeking help when they get lost in a game, so videos that guide players where to go are very popular. Also, if they take a break for a couple of days in between their game play sessions, they may check Game Help when resuming their game session to get reoriented with the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Games can provide several types of hints, such as a photo, text, a video, or a combination of video and text. Of these, we found that players used video with text hints the most.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart - Finding collectibles\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/calmhelpfulgermanspitz#?secret=Tcm0mw34rV' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>On a collectible hunt? Look to Game Help to tie up loose ends<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">How hints are determined for an activity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Because all players have different preferences, the goal is to allow players to have control over how much help they are receiving. To achieve this, we encourage game creators to&nbsp; provide hints that provide \u201cprogressive disclosure.\u201d An example of this is where the first hint would be just a nudge, such as a picture and a vague bit of text. The second hint gives a bit more information, such as a short clip showing the first couple steps to take, but not any further. Finally, the third hint shows the full walkthrough or answer, such as a video with all the steps to complete the objective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Tips for players using Game Help<strong><br><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Two popular features within Game Help are the pin-to-side mode and quickly accessing multiple hints, in addition to checking Activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Multiple hints<\/strong> can be accessed by pressing R1\/L1 to go to the next hint. Sometimes the first hint you see may be just a slight nudge, so checking to see if there are multiple hints is worth doing to make sure you don\u2019t miss one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart - Navigating and pinning hints\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/yearlyclearcutblackrussianterrier#?secret=8AmHPSpR9p' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Pin Game Help to the side so you can play and follow guidance simultaneously.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Pin-to-side<\/strong> lets you see the hint and watch the Game Help video while you play, while also giving you quick access to the Game Help card with the rest of the hints for the objective you are working on.

Hitting the PS button twice switches you over to the Game Help card to easily close it, or switch to another hint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Game Help feature is just in its infancy, and we expect to see it evolve over time.

In the video, Astro runs in the general direction of the secret but it\u2019s up to the player to do the final bit. There are over 100 help clips in Astro\u2019s Playroom.

In the last few chapters of Maquette, the difficulty ramp up caused by moving the entire recursive world can be really confusing. But, with a few hints, many of our players were able to understand the new mechanics and continue on their own.\u201d<\/em><\/p><cite>&#8211; <strong><em>Hanford Lemoore, Creative Director, Graceful Decay<\/em><\/strong><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"ps-block-separator has-max-width-40\"\/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Oddworld: Soulstorm\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/ripeheavenlygrebe#?secret=cKwfbxohPb' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Oddworld: Soulstorm<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"ps-block-separator has-max-width-40\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote ps-author-quote is-style-default has-max-width-75 has-margin-top-65 has-margin-bottom-65\"><p><em>\u201cWe introduce a number of systems in this game that might be new to Oddworld fans &#8211; inventory, crafting, advanced motion controls and so on, and so Game Help bolsters our own internal tutorials by immediately giving players access to pre-recorded videos and textual hints on how to use these systems and how to make the best out of Abe&#8217;s items.

Last year, we announced Endless Dungeon, Amplitude Studios\u2019 next rogue-lite tower-defense dungeon-crawler (yes, it\u2019s quite a mouthful), and the trailer and first glimpses of gameplay were met with a great deal of enthusiasm by a great many people. We are thrilled to see so many people eager to gather their teams and fight their way through an ancient space station to finally escape an endless loop of death and rebirth, yet one question has been on everybody\u2019s mind: How does a game with this particular string of genre descriptors work, and how do you weigh the moment to moment action against tactics and long-term planning? That\u2019s why today we\u2019re back with a new trailer illuminating four basic rules of being successful in Endless Dungeon:<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video has-agegate\" data-youtube-id=\"nYyFLcholLI\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/nYyFLcholLI\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"Endless Dungeon&#8217;s four rules of survival\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"TED SONY GIF 1\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/unselfishglitteringfairybluebird#?secret=I27OMkXREl' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Rule 1: Know Your Enemies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The station is inhabited by many critters of all manner of shapes and sizes. Some may be small and numerous, others large and imposing, but most importantly they are all quite dangerous, so you would do well to stop them quickly. Whatever you\u2019re facing, you need to remember the strengths and weaknesses of your enemies and bring the right tools for the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">A big gun that shoots lightning bolts might slice through tough robotic enemies, but it might not do so hot against the countless creepy crawlers bearing down on you. So when the swarm comes knocking, you better put away the lightning gun and kill it with fire instead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"TED SONY GIF 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/palatablefrayeddugong#?secret=fjqD7tDfcs' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Rule 2: Defend Your Crystal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To unravel the secrets of this ancient space station and learn to escape its endless cycle, you will need to power its systems with a mysterious object known only as the crystal. While the Crystal is invaluable to your quest, it\u2019s unfortunately not terribly robust, and it attracts a lot of attention. You really don\u2019t want a horde of monsters gnawing on it, but if you are to get anywhere in your exploration of this place, you really can\u2019t stick around and babysit it. That\u2019s where the turrets come in: Since you can\u2019t be everywhere at once, you\u2019ll have to protect the approaches to your crystal with a variety of turrets, secure choke points, and prepare a route to the next leg of your journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"TED SONY GIF 3\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/hilariousimaginarygermanwirehairedpointer#?secret=w3f1sLk8cv' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Rule 3: Check Your Buddies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In a floating wreck filled with mysteries and monsters, it\u2019s dangerous to go alone, so take some friends with you, and never split the party\u2026 unless you have to. Even keeping rule #2 in mind, you may still need to cover multiple directions, so you can\u2019t group up and face every threat together, but you should always but you always need to keep an eye on your buddies and how they\u2019re doing. Our heroes are exceptional individuals with a great deal of experience, yet even they might just not have the firepower to push back the onslaught, so be ready to move and help out in a pinch. Between your weapons and your abilities, focusing the attention of two or three heroes in the same spot is sure to see you through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"TED SONY GIF 4\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/reliablethoroughhoiho#?secret=4VUdZNYte9' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Rule 4: Adapt Your Squad<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Even if you have mastered the first three rules, you might still fail sometimes, overwhelmed by wave after relentless wave of enemies. At times like these, the odds might seem insurmountable, and you might be tempted to quit, but perhaps it is simply time to let one of your heroes catch a break and rethink your team. Whether it\u2019s raw firepower or survivability you need, a different group of heroes might just bring the skills (and perhaps synergies) you need to succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We hope you enjoyed this brief look at how to survive, and maybe even thrive, in Endless Dungeon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey all!

Enemies of Asgard seek these flickering remnants of life and light to bring forth the end of the world &#8211; Ragnar\u00f6k. That\u2019s where you come in. There are two ways you and your friends can save Midgard: an Adventure mode where you will need to try and defeat our challenging seasonal boss, and a survival-based \u201chow long can you survive?\u201d style Endless mode.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"TreeChop\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/hiddensneakyblackmamba#?secret=rG6CCAwFUs' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Thrive in the wilderness by hacking and slashing through enemies, and collecting the resources necessary to craft tools and gear to help you survive. You can of course explore the world on your own, but we recommend you bring along some friends along with you, as you can play with up to 9 others! The world of Midgard is full of treasures to discover &#8211; including enhancements that can have dramatic effects on combat, gathering and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"BeachFight\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/perfumeddependablehagfish#?secret=4shDxAWPrP' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But before you can slay Trolls and conquer enemy camps, every mighty Viking has to start somewhere &#8211; for you, that&#8217;s with a few sticks and some flint. Gather these materials to craft basic tools, allowing you to harvest sturdy crafting materials like wood, ore, and stone. You can also chase the heck out of some deer to get leather for armor, but crafting a weapon might be the easier option. For more advanced equipment, you\u2019ll need some of the fancier resources that you won\u2019t find in the average rock &#8211; like silver, gemstones, and obsidian. Oh, and look out for Eir Effigy\u2019s (statues that provide boons for health, speed and mana) scattered around the wilderness. They can be a lifeline&#8230;because if you die out there, your Souls are gone for good, and you have to make quite the hike to retrieve all the loot you dropped. Think of all that deer meat, left out there in the wild for the scavengers!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once you\u2019re back at the safety of your village, pool your resources at the War Chest. You can level up the many Villager Stations about town, giving yourself access to the best weapons, armor and power-ups (potions, buffs, etc.) a Viking can dream of! You&#8217;ll craft fortified materials from your friendly villagers (who will also help you in combat!), and use Souls you collect from enemies, to construct mighty gates and watchtowers. Make sure to spend time preparing and building up your defenses by strengthening village walls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"WeaponSpell\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/wiltedwaterloggedblobfish#?secret=PHFOsPoVD6' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Stave off Ragnar\u00f6k by protecting the Seed within your village from the hordes of Helthings that arrive each night.

Some of those rewards may be a little more than a quick jaunt from the village walls, and will require you to build bridges and ramps to scale cliffs and cross rivers to reach these unknown corners of Midgard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Build1\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/perfumeduntidyindochinahogdeer#?secret=UxynA3DfhW' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Helthings aren\u2019t even the most dangerous enemies you\u2019ll face.<strong> <\/strong>Every few days, an enormous Giant (aka J\u00f6tunn) will march towards your Village to try and destroy the Seed.

Immerse yourself at the heart of the Jurassic World franchise and see how things turn out when you are put at the helm of managing new challenges with unpredictable outcomes.&nbsp; In addition to these two modes, we also have returning favourites, Challenge mode where you can test your managing abilities and Sandbox mode which gives you full creativity to build your own Jurassic World.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233378702_c4001dcaec_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233378702_c4001dcaec_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Jurassic World Evolution 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And when it comes to the stars of the show, the dinosaurs, we are happy to be bringing more than 75 prehistoric species in Jurassic World Evolution 2, including all-new flying and marine reptiles, which will greatly expand the roster of species you can introduce into your parks. You will be able to see these prehistoric marvels seek out their own territory, fight and interact with staggering realism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You\u2019ll recognise many diverse prehistoric species from the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films in our announcement trailer, such as the Triceratops and the Stegosaurus. In addition, we are also happy to introduce&nbsp; species in Jurassic World Evolution 2 that haven\u2019t&nbsp; graced the silver screen, like the Amargasaurus, a smaller sauropod featuring twin rows of distinctive parallel spines down its back. Whether it\u2019s familiar species or ones you haven\u2019t seen before, we\u2019re looking forward to you showcasing each of the fascinating creatures on offer in your parks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235145910_5b95cdeda4_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235145910_5b95cdeda4_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Jurassic World Evolution 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You will also be able to take full control of your park and facilities in Jurassic World Evolution 2 with deeper management tools, such as deploying new park teams, and fresh creative options, such as customising your guest buildings. Along with our updated management options, we have a range of new, distinct biomes in Jurassic World Evolution 2, no longer contained to the Muertes Islands. Each of these biomes come with their own unique set of conditions, terrain and environmental challenges, ranging from dense forests to rocky deserts. Control is firmly in your hands, until chaos finds a way&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Whether it\u2019s the awe-inspiring new species, deeper management or authentic new narrative campaign, Jurassic World Evolution 2 will have a lot to offer and we can\u2019t wait to share more with you.

Hypnotix, EA, Petroglyph. I had been making my own game on the side for about three or four years at this point, and Sony placed a bet on me. They played an early build of Axiom Verge and saw some potential that others may not have seen, and that has made all the difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">They showed Axiom Verge in their booth at E3, where it won Best in Show from IGN and GameSpot. They included the demo in their kiosks at major retailers. They lent me their megaphone to tell the world about my little game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235643974_cd25fe7c02_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235643974_cd25fe7c02_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Axiom Verge 2\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">So as I was working on Axiom Verge 2, I felt I owed it both to Sony and all of the earliest fans of Axiom Verge to bring it to PS4 and PS5. I can\u2019t imagine launching any other way. I am excited to confirm here and now that the PS4 version will be available on day one. I am going to try my best to get the PS5 version ready for launch, but that might take a bit longer since I really want to take advantage of that in-game hints system!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234739371_ca99a8a396_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234739371_ca99a8a396_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Axiom Verge 2\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If you haven\u2019t heard of Axiom Verge, I\u2019ll give you a quick rundown. Axiom Verge is a 2D pixel art action-exploration game about a scientist named Trace who wakes up in an alien world called Sudra after a lab accident. I won\u2019t spoil the story for those who haven\u2019t played it (which begs the question: why haven\u2019t you??) but suffice it to say the storyline includes themes of what makes us&#8230;us and questions of morality and reality. You can also shoot lots of creatures with tons of different weapons and find hidden areas in a labyrinthian map.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Most people assumed that the sequel would pick up that story where it left off; namely, about the relationship between Trace and the antagonist, Athetos. But fans of Axiom Verge also know to expect the unexpected. I\u2019ve actually been hiding a secret from everyone. The story of Trace, Elsenova, and Athetos is just a small sidestory in a much larger universe spanning thousands of years and about seven or eight games. Axiom Verge 2 is about Indra, a mysterious billionaire\/tech genius who winds up in an alternate version of Earth while in Antarctica. Although there are references to the first game, you won\u2019t actually see how they relate until Axiom Verge 3. Because they are separate experiences, you won\u2019t have to have played Axiom Verge 1 to enjoy Axiom Verge 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It would be boring both for myself as a developer and for fans of Axiom Verge if Indra interacted with the world in the same way that Trace did. I didn\u2019t want Axiom Verge 2 to be Axiom Verge 1&#8230;only bigger. So although the core DNA of the game is intact\u2014exploring a labyrinthian world map in particular\u2014the majority of the gameplay and environments are quite different.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">First, since it is set on Earth, the world has a much more Earth-like feel with gentle slopes in place of the blocky alien landscape. You\u2019ll notice from this early tileset how different the look and feel of the game is from the original:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234867766_7504be63ac_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234867766_7504be63ac_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Axiom Verge 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And here it is in action:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-14.81% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(44.44% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Axiom Verge 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/bestuncomfortabledwarfrabbit#?secret=e58t01xSEn' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Although I try to put on my blinders with respect to other people\u2019s opinions about my games and stay true to my original vision, one common theme came up when I watched people play. There were some people who wished the game were a lot harder, and there were those who wanted it to be easier. Some loved the exploration but just got to a boss they couldn\u2019t get past. That\u2019s happened to me. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had to stop playing a game because of a choke point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I addressed the difficulty issue in two ways. First, I\u2019m letting players adjust their own difficulty settings. Rather than choosing among an Easy, Normal, and Hard Mode, players can adjust both how much damage they do and how much enemies damage you. Second, bosses are optional. You will be rewarded for defeating them, but gone are the days where they stood in between you and the rest of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But in addition to the approach to bosses and the landscape, combat itself is very different. For one thing, Indra does not have the sheer range of weapons that Trace had at his disposal. She starts off with a pickaxe and does a lot of her fighting up close and personal. Fortunately for her, it\u2019s a question of brains over brawn, and she can use her technical skills as a tech genius to hack her enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There is so much more ground to cover, but I\u2019m doing my best to avoid spoilers. I\u2019m putting some of the finishing touches on the game as we speak and am looking forward to releasing it later this summer. I can\u2019t wait to see what the legion of PlayStation fans discover.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was the year 2014, and my video game career to this point had been one as an unknown role player at larger studios and publishers.

Today we are thrilled to announce a landmark deal for Deviation Games, working with Sony Interactive Entertainment to develop a brand-new original IP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When my partner Jason Blundell and I first met decades ago, we often dreamt about having our own studio, making games our way with our own team of like-minded developers, and building a community where lasting friendships are created. That dream has become a reality today. We feel so fortunate to have this incredible opportunity \u2013 one for Jason and I to build something completely new from the ground up, to fearlessly innovate and forge an incredible community and legacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We call ourselves Deviators. And as Jason describes it, \u201cAnother way of saying Deviator is Renaissance mindset. Deviators are not only passionate about their own discipline, but they love others too. We believe that is what is unique and special about our studio, the culture, the team, and this project.&nbsp; From experience, young determined studios need rock solid support to thrive. That\u2019s why it means so much that PlayStation is partnering with us on our first game. As you all know&#8211;having enjoyed the amazing PlayStation Studios portfolio&#8211;they know what it takes to make great games. To have a partner like that behind us makes the road ahead simply breathtaking.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I know what you\u2019re thinking as you read this. What kind of game are we making? How long have we already been working on it? Is it story based? Multiplayer? Co-op? Or all of the above and more? When is it coming out? While I can confirm development is already underway, it\u2019s really early for us to be going into specific details. We\u2019re drawing on what we\u2019ve learned over our collective decades making games, but we\u2019re also out to make something fresh and brimming with innovation like you\u2019ve never experienced before. We\u2019re not afraid to say that our ambitions are super high: we\u2019re setting out to make a huge, content-rich game with a focus on a lot of action and a lot of energy, but let\u2019s leave it at that for now and hopefully it won\u2019t be long before we can share more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As for today, I\u2019m here to say: keep an eye on us&#8211;we\u2019ve brought on amazing talent from around the world, we\u2019re over 100 Deviators and growing fast, and we have an incredible partner behind us in SIE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">&nbsp;To our fans, particularly those who\u2019ve followed some of our team members\u2019 past work over the years: thank you for all your support, particularly now as we venture into creating something for ourselves. Follow our studio channels for all the latest and stay tuned.

Development began after I\u2019d already shipped a few games with what I\u2019d humbly claim had <em>adequate<\/em> combat and gameplay. Like so many other indie devs, I\u2019d recently become obsessed with the Dark Souls formula: its numerous seemingly inscrutable systems, its beautifully dark and imaginative world, and its tense moments where razor thin margins for error emerged elegantly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video has-agegate\" data-youtube-id=\"ZnBkp9ascxc\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/ZnBkp9ascxc\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"Leaving Sanctuary: Ska Studios\u2019 journey to Salt and Sacrifice\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I\u2019d built some pretty competent combat systems in The Dishwasher series (which is now unbelievably two console generations old), so the idea of using that as a foundation for exploring an indie soulslike made sense. From there, it was a lot of world pieces, monsters, weapons, and <em>more<\/em>: all hand-drawn, hand-animated, scripted, and placed; a gradual journey to see if the bones of 2D brawling could animate the flesh of this dark fantasy RPG.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235074545_540199a7f1_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235074545_540199a7f1_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Salt and Sacrifice\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In hindsight, I\u2019m certainly a little in the dark about what worked best for Salt and Sanctuary, not that there is a single right answer. For some, the lore stood out. For others, it was the elaborate skill tree. The fighter DNA resonated with some people. But to so very many people, the lack of online co-op was the most egregious omission, which brings me to Salt and Sacrifice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Salt and Sacrifice expands on the world of Salt and Sanctuary by exploring a new era and region, as well as a new role: a Marked Inquisitor. A Marked Inquisitor is a criminal condemned, yet spared the hand of justice in exchange for a lifetime of service in the unending war against Mages: twisted, irredeemable creatures of elemental malice. Mages roam the world, summoning minions and wreaking havoc. Hunting a Mage is a multistage pursuit in which your quarry is just as likely to clash with rival Mages as it is with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Salt and Sacrifice\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/lankydefenselessbuffalo#?secret=UEYwm48fZV' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For those of you who have played Salt and Sanctuary, imagine pursuing The Queen of Smiles through the village: she summons two rotten crossbowmen, retreats, stumbles right into The Sodden Knight, scraps it out with him for a bit, retreats again, summons a bronze knight and launches a salvo of swords at you before retreating to her lair, where &#8212; cornered, desperate, fierce &#8212; she awaits you, for a final battle from which there is no escape. It\u2019s a chaotic dance of blades and bolts, swords and spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234009946_2f1d7409b3_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234009946_2f1d7409b3_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Salt and Sacrifice\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And while questions of which systems and themes will and won\u2019t make the cut remain, one thing is certain: Salt and Sacrifice will absolutely have online multiplayer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I had been sending screenshots of a new game I had started in 2019 to my friend Shane Lynch, a fellow coder who\u2019d played unwitting victim in a number of my D&amp;D campaigns through the years. \u201cYou should add online multiplayer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he joked (or so I thought). He has a really strong background in network programming. I do not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Salt and Sacrifice\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/dishonestmelodicgentoopenguin#?secret=prxDprUFOn' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It probably took me longer to warm up to the idea of programming cooperatively (and learning git) than it did for Shane to implement bare bones netcode. Within about a week he had something working. It was glitchy at first, but there\u2019s something magical about that virtual first contact. After spending months creating a brand new world, it\u2019s a bizarre delight to see someone else just sort of hanging out in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233306952_61c137bcca_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233306952_61c137bcca_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Salt and Sacrifice\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Salt and Sanctuary had co-op that was intentionally obscured and as rudimentary as it comes: local only, same-screen. It was rough, but it was still adored. Because Shane and I are building Salt and Sacrifice from the ground up as a multiplayer game, co-op is much more intentional than it was in Sanctuary. There is a \u201cfull\u201d co-op mode, playable online and locally, in which you and an ally can progress through the entire campaign together. Unlike Sanctuary, which only awarded progress to the main player, Salt and Sacrifice allows both players to share progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Salt and Sacrifice\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/gregariousidleleafwing#?secret=P5sYGyZDsn' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Drawing inspiration from the Souls series, we also implemented summoning mechanics. It\u2019s easy, seamless, and fast to summon a random ally, or join a random host and together embark on a perilous expedition. Sacrifice emphasizes exploration as much as it does Mage hunts, so you may get summoned to help a player explore a new area, or you may get summoned for the sole purpose of barreling straight into a tough boss battle. As Sacrifice takes shape, witnessing the impact of multiplayer on a world that is still rapidly growing in density and complexity has been a uniquely cool experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234221848_0d6c7ce911_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234221848_0d6c7ce911_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Salt and Sacrifice\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We still have quite a ways to go, but this has already been one of the most exciting developments in my now strangely long career.

In this new DLC, users will be experiencing a new arc based on the story of an extra chapter\/episode of the manga\/anime. This arc sets focus on an alternative future, where Gohan and Trunks fight the Androids to restore peace to a desperate world without Goku or any of the other Z Warriors.

Being spotted by these drones can lead to a fatality, as they will set off an alert, automatically throwing you in a death match against Android 17 and 18. The androids are much stronger compared to the ones you\u2019ve fought in the main story, and your only chance of survival is to find a way to escape by clearing specific conditions in battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234761314_e3b764dd41_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234761314_e3b764dd41_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I don\u2019t want to spoil it for users who haven\u2019t watched the anime, so I won\u2019t go much further into the story, but I assure you that this will be a story you won\u2019t forget.

Hi, I\u2019m Lena Raine and I am going to tell you about the fun audioscape built for Chicory. I\u2019ve worked on a lot of past titles such as Celeste, Minecraft, and Guild Wars 2. For Chicory, I did all of the music composition and soundtrack recording for the game. We also got to work with sound designer Em Halberstadt (Night in the Woods, Untitled Goose Game, Wandersong) who, along with Preston Wright, designed all of the sound you hear in the pleasant, cozy, and even spooky areas of the game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There\u2019s a lot of tradition associated with music composition and implementation in screen-based adventure games like Chicory: A Colorful Tale. While composing for Chicory, I wanted to hold true to some of those traditions while also pushing conventions by drawing inspiration from the dynamic music of free-form open world games.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.84% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.52% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"trailer-rerelease-gameplay\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/caninepeacefulgossamerwingedbutterfly#?secret=7qQ4JvfIls' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Dynamic music helps give a sense of place between each screen of the game. While each major area has its own looping theme that enters alongside its title card, we made the transitions between areas feel much more smooth and gradual. So instead of simply hard cutting or fading between tracks, we have what we call &#8220;outskirts&#8221; areas that let each major area&#8217;s music drift away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Depending on where you come from, the music changes to a more subtle, low-key version of the music. Stick around long enough, and the track will simply fade away. But if you enter the same screen from another direction, that other area&#8217;s music will become more low-key. By making some screens music-agnostic, we&#8217;re able to help bridge the gap and smoothly transition between areas as you explore.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Some places even have progressive music that changes and evolves as you explore, so keep an ear out to hear how the music follows your adventures!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234874903_c4aeab66fe_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234874903_c4aeab66fe_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chicory:&nbsp; A Colorful Tale\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As a fun fact, every woodwind you hear in the score was recorded live by Kristin Naigus! Here&#8217;s every instrument she recorded from the soundtrack all lined up, which joins an ensemble that also includes violin, viola, cello, and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With Em\u2019s input on the sound design side of things, the musical transition between areas was also intended to give the player a moment to sit back and listen to the ambience and all the detail we put into the paint sounds. We wanted the sound effects to help the player feel like they really are painting, so Em really made it as tactile and detailed as she could.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.84% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.52% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"trailer-rerelease-paintings\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/impracticalniftyarctichare#?secret=uNy3ha4atL' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Em\u2019s process for sound design is pretty great and her process for Chicory was no exception. To start, she had a big recording session with a can of paint and some glue to make it thick and globby. Most of the paintbrush, interactable objects, and menu sounds are made out of the squishing and slurping that came out of that session. Even the darker moments in the game use those recordings, they\u2019re just pitched down and reversed to sound more ominous. The physical nature of the sounds helps make them satisfying.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It was really important to make the brush feel nuanced and realistic, so the paint sound follows the speed of your brush, and all the different brush styles and stamps have their own special sounds. We made all the paint related audio come from the DualSense wireless controller to really make it feel like you\u2019re using your hands to color this world. The vibrations contribute to this as well. While this is all subtle, it comes together to give you an experience where you can relax easily if you want to and take some time exploring your creativity.&nbsp; Regardless of how you play, the pops and bubbles you\u2019ll hear as the world reacts to your brush will tickle your ears.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235729090_7e79d2ac7e_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235729090_7e79d2ac7e_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chicory:&nbsp; A Colorful Tale\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Players are all going to approach the game differently, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing them all! Whether you\u2019re adventuring and puzzling, or relaxing and painting, we put a lot of thought and care into making Chicory a world that sounds great for you. With Game Help keeping you on track, and the cozy-rumbly controller vibration features, we think it\u2019s a world that players can feel comfortable in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And don\u2019t be afraid to use your Share or Create button because we\u2019ll be watching for everyone\u2019s artwork on social media!

Battlefield 2042 launches later this year on October 22 with development handled by Dice, Criterion, Dice LA, and EA Gothenburg. Coming to both PS4 and PS5, it continues the series\u2019 ambitious trajectory of incorporating cutting-edge tech to increase the size and density of its sandboxes, while retooling and expanding its vast armory of gameplay modes and mechanics. It boasts one of the biggest maps in the series to date. The real-time unpredictability of extreme weather systems that\u2019ll tear through the frontline. Enhanced terrain deformation. And, on PS5, a 128-player count per match. This is Dice\u2019s proprietary game engine Frostbite flexing all-new processing muscle acquired in the two or so years since last entry Battlefield V.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234353333_78ec842fe4_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234353333_78ec842fe4_o.png\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It also marks the franchise\u2019s return to (near) modern day. The real-world yet fictitious setting pitches a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario of societies crumbling in the face of violent climate changes and diminishing resources. Stateless soldiers (\u201cNo-Pat Specialists\u201d) now fight on behalf of the remaining superpowers. The setup is close enough to today to be recognisable, but far enough in the future to include advanced arsenals and destructive weather patterns. Fitting though with the series\u2019 20th anniversary coming up, that EA offers a nod &#8211; unintentional or otherwise &#8211; to franchise starter Battlefield 1942 in its selection of year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233440082_8bbdd7bcf1_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233440082_8bbdd7bcf1_o.png\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">All Out Warfare\u2019s Conquest and Breakthrough&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There are three gameplay pillars &#8211; \u201cexperiences\u201d- to 2042. Only two have been named. Of that pair only All Out Warfare is the focus of this first look, debuting with a duo of familiar modes. Hazard Zone, as well as the mystery third pillar &#8211; in development at Dice LA &#8211; will get their full reveal at a later date.&nbsp; Dice reinforce Hazard Zone is something all-new for the franchise: a modern take on multiplayer that\u2019s a \u201chigh-stakes, squad-based game type\u201d. The studio is emphatic in stressing it isn\u2019t a battle royale mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234921599_9b76418680_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234921599_9b76418680_o.png\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>As ever, there\u2019ll be a fleet of vehicles to jump into during matches. Players will have access to a call-in tablet, letting them request a land-based vehicle to anywhere on the map. They can be deadly even before you hop in: Dice example pinpointing a tank to land onto an enemy sniper position.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">So, those two All Out Warfare modes. Conquest has two teams duking it out on a huge space, with epic clashes and more personal frays playing out in pockets across a map. Breakthrough also drops two opposing sides into a single location, but is more guided: maps are divided up into sectors, in which there are multiple capture points. Attacking or defending sides need to hold points to flip sectors and shift an ever-moving frontline in their favour. Want time to get adjusted to what\u2019s new and test things out? You can launch both modes with AI squadmates (and Dice confirms doing so still contributes to your overall progress).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235208695_1feca42445_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51235208695_1feca42445_o.png\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Maps and their dynamic events&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">A quick tour of both modes and some of the maps demonstrate Dice\u2019s approach to shaping a satisfying ebb and flow to battles. There\u2019s a look at locales based on real-world settings &#8211; desert cities, tanker rigs, cragged mountaintops &#8211; their geography catering to different insertion methods and combat approaches. Go big with multi-vehicle combat spectaculars, keep it tense with close-quarter combat and everything in-between.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Map-specific dynamic events are teased &#8211; visibility-altering sandstorms, a space rocket launch, destructive tornadoes. That last can be turned to your advantage with, as one example, the new wingsuits. If your Specialist comes equipped with one, you can ride the wind &#8211; just beware of debris and vehicles snatched into the storm. A potent mix of on-the-fly tactics and strategies carefully considered &#8211; lowering or raising bridges, locking down cranes, managing doorways &#8211; are designed to keep you thinking and be hyper-aware of your surroundings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Those dynamic world events will feature whichever console you play on. PS4 player count per All Out Warfare match is 64, and subsequently PlayStation 4\u2019s maps have been built with a smaller, more focused layout in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">All Out Warfare launches with seven maps total. Let\u2019s take a quick tour of those:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233441902_d3a1b3fd6c_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51233441902_d3a1b3fd6c_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Kaleidoscope [Sogdo, South Korea] <\/strong>This cityscape features dense roadways and skyscrapers that can be explored, or if you\u2019ve a wingsuit, leapt off.

Each comes with a unique Speciality and Trait. The former may take the shape of a grappling hook (for Assault types only &#8211; a quick zip to higher spots) OV-P Recon Drone (the mark of the Recon &#8211; which can be piloted or parked to pinpoint targets) or S21 Syrette Pistol (handled by Support &#8211; firing health vials at those who need them). Those nicely pair with Traits. Assault types are known for their nimbleness, whereas a Support Specialist doubles as a Combat Surgeon, capable of fully restoring a comrade\u2019s health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Beyond those two unique abilities, Specialists can be customised with whatever loadout you wish, giving you more freedom to create a playstyle that fits you. Battlefield 2042 will offer 10 Specialists on launch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234938774_a51025e78d_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51234938774_a51025e78d_o.png\" alt=\"Battlefield 2042\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The Plus system (not shown) lets you customise your selected weapon without taking your eyes off the battlefield.

Post launch, Battlefield 2042\u2019s first year promises four seasons of content, bringing with them four new Specialists plus new locations. Each season is marked by a new Battle Pass.

This means she doesn\u2019t need to rely on elemental materia like Cloud and his friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Instead, focus on equipping her with stat-boosting materia and ability materia that expands her options in combat. We\u2019re partial to Steal ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"03 Synergized Windstorm v2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/unfitsinfulirishwaterspaniel#?secret=kzaOntnnd0' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">3. <strong>Know when to synergize<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Pressing L2 will engage Synergy between Yuffie and Sonon. This allows them to team up for special attacks and more easily stagger enemies. Plus, it looks awesome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If that sounds too good to be true\u2026 well, you\u2019re right. Using Synergy will slow your ATB gauge regeneration to a crawl. So, be sure to maximize your time in and out of Synergy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"04 Sonon using Incite\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/tightdeafeninghamadryad#?secret=lJxSpW1Tos' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">4. <strong>Let Sonon take the hits<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Yuffie\u2019s ninjutsu is incredibly strong, but she\u2019s not invincible. A tough enemy or group of enemies can easily overwhelm her if she\u2019s not careful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It\u2019s a good thing then that she\u2019s not alone. Sonon trained under Yuffie\u2019s father in Wutai, and not only is he a skilled warrior, he\u2019s pretty buff, too. So, use him to take the brunt of the enemies\u2019 ire wherever you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We recommend equipping Sonon with Provoke materia, which lets him draw an enemy\u2019s attention, and gives Yuffie a bit of breathing room. You can also command him to use his Incite ability in battle, which lets him grab an enemy\u2019s attention for three attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Stay on your toes though \u2013 it\u2019s not so effective when used on powerful enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"05 Fort Condor battle\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/frequentripejerboa#?secret=hScF33yrBT' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">5. <strong>Fort Condor strategy tips<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Fort Condor, ranged units get a bonus against defense units, defense units get a bonus against vanguard (attack) units, and vanguard units get a bonus against ranged units.

Shoot one down to become the pilot, then use it to attack and abduct. What to shoot it down with? This Season introduces new, high-tech weapons to take advantage of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Created by the IO, pick up the Pulse Rifle for a versatile weapon that\u2019ll rarely let you down. Word has it Doctor Slone carries a special version reserved for herself, so you\u2019ll need to square off with her directly to call it your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51231014497_4aa77613df_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51231014497_4aa77613df_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Fortnite\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The Pulse Rifle. The IO takes great pride in this item.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The IO has also invented the Rail Gun, which lets you shoot past surfaces. Don\u2019t get too complacent, though: the Rail Gun has a targeting beam that\u2019ll make your presence known. Unsurprising coming from the IO, it happens to do extra damage against Saucers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51232779605_5afad71baf_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51232779605_5afad71baf_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Fortnite\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>With the Rail Gun\u2019s defiance of physics, some find it surprising it\u2019s not of Alien origin.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Though not a weapon per se, the IO has additionally invented the Pulse Scanner. This device fires Recon Bolts, marking all opponents (and Chests) in their diameter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Aliens have appliances of their own, too. With the Kymera Ray Gun, fire a continuous beam and only stop to recharge. It doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of damage against structures or Saucers (so it may not be the best choice if you\u2019re trying to shoot one down!), but it\u2019s powerful against opponents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51231929283_6ac8f459d3_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51231929283_6ac8f459d3_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Fortnite\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The temperature of the Kymera Ray Gun\u2019s beam is the same as that of molten lava.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">IO researchers believe the Aliens are working on even more technology, like a weapon that can move objects and a device that can disguise the possessor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">The Chapter 2 Season 7 Battle Pass<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Fitting for the cosmic occasion, Battle Stars make their return to the Battle Pass! This Season, they function in a new way. Collect Battle Stars as you level up, then use those Stars to claim rewards in the order you want them. By claiming rewards or reaching certain Levels, you\u2019ll unlock additional pages of rewards to claim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Want to claim the Abduction Contrail on Page 1 straight away?

Prefer a support role? More into risk\/reward-type builds? Are you more interested in ranged vs. melee combat? In Chivalry 2 there are so many character classes and subclasses to choose from that there\u2019s bound to be a build that strikes your fancy. So in anticipation of the game\u2019s full release, we\u2019ve broken down each class to further help you decide how you want to experience the 64-player medieval madness of Chivalry 2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224495542_2253d7f8c7_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224495542_2253d7f8c7_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chivalry 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Archer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Health: <\/strong>100 | <strong>Movement Speed: <\/strong>100 | <strong>Stamina: <\/strong>60<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With a fun mix of ranged weapons from crossbows to throwable javelins, Archers are the preferred class for anyone who wants to do damage from afar. With a Special that charges faster with successful headshots, the Archer class is designed to reward players who are especially deadly, but they also have significantly lower health compared to the other three classes in the game. There are only a limited number of Archers allowed per team, so make sure you snag a spot quickly!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Subclasses: <\/strong>Longbowman, Crossbowman, Skirmisher<\/li><li><strong>Special Abilities: <\/strong>Brazier (light arrows on fire), Banner (heal allies), Quiver (restock ammo)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225970299_67945a938b_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225970299_67945a938b_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chivalry 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Knight<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Health:<\/strong> 175 | <strong>Movement Speed: <\/strong>80 | <strong>Stamina: <\/strong>80<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With the Knight\u2019s larger health pool, it\u2019s the top pick for beginners hopping into Chivalry 2 for the first time. The Knight\u2019s arsenal is also very balanced with subclasses that allow a wide range of options to try out like the shield-wielding Guardian or the high-damage Crusader. Before going for a class that\u2019s a little more specialized, try out the Knight to get a taste of a little bit of everything the others have to offer. Worst case, you\u2019ll probably die a bit slower.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Subclasses:<\/strong> Officer, Guardian, Crusader<\/li><li><strong>Special Abilities:<\/strong> Oil Pot (fire throwable), Trumpet (heal allies), Banner (heal allies)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224495377_200d3ab432_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224495377_200d3ab432_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chivalry 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Footman<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Health:<\/strong> 150 | <strong>Movement Speed: <\/strong>100 | <strong>Stamina: <\/strong>80<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Footman is a good Jack of All Trades, and also Chivalry 2\u2019s answer for a \u201csupport\u201d type class. As such, players in this class are equipped with items and abilities that favor defense and combat strategy. Bandage kits are the special ability for each of the footman\u2019s three subclasses, and can be deployed to help your teammates resupply bandages and heal themselves. Footmen also benefit from increased movement speed compared to Knights, and a unique arsenal featuring long two-handed weapons with the most range (halberds, spears, polearms etc.) Additionally, the Footman is able to place traps and barricades to strategically turn the tide of combat and direct enemies elsewhere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Subclasses: <\/strong>Poleman, Man at Arms, Field Engineer<\/li><li><strong>Special Ability: <\/strong>Bandage Kit (heal allies)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225203521_5b64af3f07_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225203521_5b64af3f07_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Chivalry 2\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Vanguard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Health: <\/strong>130 | <strong>Movement Speed: <\/strong>120 | <strong>Stamina:<\/strong> 100<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For the Vanguard class, it\u2019s all about damage! With the lowest health pool of all of the classes, playing as a Vanguard is the ultimate risk\/reward class. If you\u2019re a dedicated warrior with a deep passion for swordplay, Vanguard\u2019s arsenal of high-damage weapons will be a good fit for you! Furthermore, the Raider subclass even allows you to carry two primary weapons, allowing for even more creative combat approaches. All of this high damage goodness comes at the cost of being more vulnerable to ranged attacks &#8211; because Vanguards don\u2019t get shields!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Subclasses: <\/strong>Brute, Raider, Ambusher<\/li><li><strong>Special Abilities: <\/strong>Trumpet (heal allies), Quiver (restock ammo), Oil Pot (fire throwable)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I hope you enjoyed this quick overview of all of the loadout options available to you when you boot up Chivalry 2.

The Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2021 was purely digital, allowing all players across the globe to partake in this special event simultaneously. There were live concerts, cosplay contests and other digitally friendly activities. As ever, the convention kicked off with the Keynote presentation, which revealed<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2021\/05\/14\/final-fantasy-xivs-new-endwalker-expansion-launches-november-23\/\"> a wealth of new content<\/a> coming to the game\u2019s fourth expansion Endwalker. As is now tradition, the game\u2019s director and producer Naoki Yoshida had an extra special treat for fans to reveal the second new job introduced in the expansion: the creator took to the stage dressed up as a Reaper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676877_b83a1719d5_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676877_b83a1719d5_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"46%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152814_42ad830db3_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152814_42ad830db3_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"46%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With the Digital Fan Festival now finished and Yoshida back in civilian clothes, we took the opportunity to talk to the creator about the Reaper job, Endwalker\u2019s music, the brand-new male Viera race, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>The second new playable job you have revealed, Reaper, is brand new to the Final Fantasy series. How did you decide to go for this job and where did you find inspiration from? Can you tell us a little bit about how Reaper will play, and what will differentiate it from the other melee DPS jobs?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Just to start things off, thank you for taking the time to conduct this interview! Now, onto the questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Whenever we brainstorm ideas for each new job in Final Fantasy XIV, our base concept and goal is to make sure that each job has a unique gameplay experience. In this case, before we even reached the stage of finding inspiration, we first looked at the overall job composition and distribution, and from there decided that we wanted to add a melee DPS. It is after that when we looked to come up with ideas as to what kind of job we wanted to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Many players around the world, especially those from the West, had been requesting the addition of a job that uses a large, two-handed scythe\u2014we used the idea of a two-handed scythe weapon as a base, and started brainstorming ideas for new jobs from there. I asked several game designers who are involved in the creation of new jobs to take some liberties and submit their ideas\u2014we discussed those ideas to make our decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152714_3752052822_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152714_3752052822_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385381_adbb392b39_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385381_adbb392b39_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One idea that came up was to utilize not only the player\u2019s own aether, but to combine it with a different source of aether to fight in battle. It was from there that we came up with the idea of a grim reaper from the scythe aspect, and from there it was a fairly straightforward process to settle on the reaper\u2019s current form. A scythe and the grim reaper. It\u2019s unexpectedly straightforward. (laughs)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The major difference between Reaper and the other melee DPS jobs is its use of voidsent \u201cavatars,\u201d which came up during our brainstorm sessions as we discussed the grim reaper idea. The player will not just attack using the avatar, but in the end, you can serve as the host for the avatar, in order to unleash more attacks. For the rest\u2026 stay tuned!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225459520_8997b7a40d_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225459520_8997b7a40d_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676817_a33fb56993_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676817_a33fb56993_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Endwalker\u2019s cinematic trailer music is now fully finished and sounds very distinct from past expansions \u2013 all the while featuring hints to all of their main themes! Can you tell us how the main theme\u2019s direction and how the collaboration with Architects&#8217; Sam Carter came to be?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The idea of a collaboration began when our team was considering the creation of a main theme that is appropriate for Endwalker<em>\u2014<\/em>the conclusion of the Hydaelyn &amp; Zodiark saga. Sound Director Masayoshi Soken, Lead Story Designer Natsuko Ishikawa, and I defined the overall direction we wanted to take in terms of what kind of \u201cvoice\u201d we were looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To us, the main theme for the trailers of each FFXIV expansion pack is not merely a song we create for the trailer, but we rearrange the track in different ways so it can be used in game, and oftentimes we use these arrangements to effectively convey definitive moments in the story. Before we jumped into the actual creation of the song itself, Ishikawa brought up her perspective of what she was envisioning for the overall voice\u2014both Soken and myself were quickly on board with her idea, and we were able to swiftly decide on the direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385526_0f789bae08_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385526_0f789bae08_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224599893_e04a83691f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224599893_e04a83691f_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We were looking for someone who not only had great vocal range that could reach high notes loudly and clearly, but also someone who could achieve screaming vocals. We conveyed this vision to the FFXIV teams in the US and Europe and asked them if they could find a good fit\u2014Sam was one of the candidates suggested by the overseas teams. We loved his sound and reached out to him shortly after, to which he responded very quickly to agree to take part in the project; from there we worked on recording the vocals, which was done remotely. That is the gist of things, but I believe there will come a time when Soken and Ishikawa would speak to further details on the creation of the theme song.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Regarding the direction of the song itself, I conveyed to Soken that we wanted to represent Hydaelyn and Zodiark as having their own voice, with male and female vocals intertwining with each other in the track. However, it was Soken\u2019s idea to incorporate motifs of each expansions\u2019 theme into the track. Overall, I feel we were able to make a song worthy of our first big story arc conclusion!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224600138_cffc0c66dc_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224600138_cffc0c66dc_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152749_a3a95d1041_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152749_a3a95d1041_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>We were able to hear for the first time some of the music featuring in a few of the new areas you presented during the keynote.

Soken allocated the songs to these areas based on his own inspiration, while making sure not to deviate too far from the overall image being portrayed. These may still be changed before they\u2019re finalized for the game, or they could potentially be used as they debuted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152654_bcf5697e21_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152654_bcf5697e21_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385281_5b16f88db5_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51224385281_5b16f88db5_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">My personal favorite is Mare Lamentorum\u2014the surface of the moon\u2014but whether or not this track will remain in that area for the official release is something only Soken knows. (laughs)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">After Endwalker releases, it might be interesting for everyone to give the walkthrough videos another look to try and spot any differences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>To everyone\u2019s surprise, Final Fantasy XIV will have a new playable race! You\u2019ve mentioned the team worked on the race in secret. Can you give us more details as to how Male Viera (and in the future, Female Hrothgar) came to be?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When we released our previous expansion, Shadowbringers, I mentioned that it would be the last time we would add a new playable race to FFXIV. I don\u2019t believe that was a lie, and I have told my development team that same thing. I say this because while adding a new playable race is very enjoyable for our players, it does pose the risk of creating unpleasant side effects, so to speak.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=1024,1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-349979 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;zoom=2 1448w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;zoom=1.5 1086w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;zoom=1 724w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;zoom=0.5 362w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_38.png?fit=724%2C1024&amp;zoom=0.25 181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"\">Adding a playable race does not end with just the initial resources needed to create the race (i.e. character modeling; preparations for variations in facial features, hairstyles and head shapes; animations that are unique to each race, etc.). Even following initial implementation, the tasks required with each patch update will multiply. For example, when we implemented the Viera, because their ears are very long, we needed to add a new review flow to check how Viera characters would appear on screen in all cutscenes. Of course, gear you can obtain as you play through the game will also need to be fitted to match the body shapes of the Viera and Hrothgar, and whenever we add emote animations, there will always be two additional sets to consider compared to what we had to do up until this point. This is something that we as a development team need to put effort into, but if these tasks multiply too much, it could cause critical damage to the interval between major updates.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Considering all of this, we ended up with the races I announced for the Shadowbringers expansion. There was a large amount of feedback asking to implement the Viera from Final Fantasy XII, and in addition, I wanted to implement a race that is more beast-like. If this was going to be the last time we added playable races, I decided to implement two races within the means of our bandwidth, despite only having one gender of each race. (One of the biggest reasons I moved forward with this decision is because there were no male Viera in Final Fantasy XII, either.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">However, there was a significant amount of people around the world asking for male Viera and female Hrothgar\u2014which was expected of course\u2014but I was going to follow through with my stance of not adding any more playable races. At the same time, our graphics staff on the development team wanted to explore all options to see what they could do to figure out a way to somehow realize this request from the players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152679_cd5adc782c_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225152679_cd5adc782c_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676672_fff33ba57e_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51223676672_fff33ba57e_h.jpg\" alt=\"FFXIV\" width=\"460\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">They spent over half a year using what free time they had in between their normal work on the patches to consider ways to add another playable race. From this they concluded that we could probably squeeze in just one more at this time. Of course, by adding male Viera now, we anticipated people may be vocal about the absence of female Hrothgar and want to know what the situation was. Rather than waiting until (hypothetically) 7.0 to add two playable races at the same time, we realized we could actually ease the impact on our resources if we implemented these one at a time. Ultimately, I decided we should then move forward with implementing one playable race at a time, and I will make sure to explain that to our players: that\u2019s what we did for this upcoming expansion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We have a desire to let our players enjoy our game even more at the very core. The development team loves our players, so when male Viera are actually implemented, we would love for you to have a smile on your faces when you play as one, and if you could say a quick \u201cThank you!\u201d to the Graphics team, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be very happy. If you can do that, I think it would also serve as motivation for our developers to continue working hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225459405_75c5e44587_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51225459405_75c5e44587_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"FFXIV\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>The new 24-man raid content, Myths of the Realm, will be an all-original FFXIV story, and speculation has been wild since you\u2019ve revealed the art and title of the next alliance raid series.

It\u2019s been quite a journey to get here, as our team has been working on creating a showpiece for the new hardware. Built from the ground up for PS5, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is, in my humble opinion, one of the most beautiful and technically impressive games ever released.&nbsp; I know the rest of the team here at Insomniac feels the same way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Over the years we\u2019ve worked on a lot of Ratchet &amp; Clank games. When I think back to those games on the PS2 and PS3 consoles, it\u2019s amazing how far we\u2019ve come. We made a video to show the evolution of things over the franchise, take a look:<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"-Mt3M6EzuWU\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/-Mt3M6EzuWU\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"Celebrating the evolution of Ratchet &#038; Clank on PlayStation\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I&#8217;ll never forget being a college freshman, working as a freelance journalist and getting an early preview build of the first Ratchet &amp; Clank. Sitting in my dorm room exploring planets with a lombax and his robot companion made an immediate impression on me. I anxiously devoured the future builds, and it was one of my favorite franchises on one of my favorite consoles of all-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218345846_86afb877a0_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218345846_86afb877a0_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank - Franchise Evolution\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank on PS2, release date: November 4, 2002<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">On the PS2 console, Ratchet &amp; Clank did what it always does: be a showpiece for your console. The games, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Going Commando, Up Your Arsenal, and Deadlocked, were gorgeous, technical showpieces for the console with huge vista views and draw-distance, incredible action and weapons, and amazing heart and humor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\u201dcenter\u201d\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219416040_2627ed7820_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219416040_2627ed7820_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank - Franchise Evolution\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal on PS2, release date: November 2, 2004<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Out of college I got a job at Insomniac Games and I got to start working on a game codenamed as Ratchet &amp; Clank Future. It was my first Ratchet &amp; Clank game, and Insomniac&#8217;s first one for the PlayStation 3 console.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We were finally starting to hit the visuals of CG-animated films at the time and taking advantage of the Cell processor and horsepower in the PS3 console. But we also began at this point to really take the story in a more heartfelt direction like those animated films we loved. We dug into Ratchet and Clank&#8217;s backstory over the Future Saga and the seminal A Crack in Time remains many fans favorite game in the franchise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\u201dcenter\u201d\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111024_9f1ab7b82d_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111024_9f1ab7b82d_b.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank - Franchise Evolution\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: A Crack in Time on PS3, release date: October 27, 2009<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also experimented down the stretch, with the 4-player game, All 4 One, and a multiplayer \/ tower defense game: Full Frontal Assault.&nbsp; We continued to work on refining the mechanics and polishing our action and gunplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111049_b9ba65bd9f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111049_b9ba65bd9f_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank - Franchise Evolution\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One on PS3, release date: October 18, 2011<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Which all came together on the PS4 console. A CG animated movie gave us the opportunity to make a game based on a movie based on a game. This re-imagined version of the original (told from Captain Qwark&#8217;s point-of-view) is a visual-tour-de-force. It allowed you to play through the origins of the characters but with years of experience in designing combat and weapons, and with amazing visuals that showed what the PS4 console was capable of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111059_06c2580a66_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219111059_06c2580a66_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank - Franchise Evolution\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank on PS4, release date: April 16, 2016<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With our next standalone entry in the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, this title was built from the ground up and designed exclusively for the PS5 console. The speed of the SSD allowed us to consider dimension hopping and portals that would whisk you across the galaxy. The power of the console let us give you our most visually spectacular Ratchet &amp; Clank game yet. The DualSense wireless controller&#8217;s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers brings Ratchet and Rivet&#8217;s arsenal to life in a whole new way. And all of the years of storytelling in the Ratchet &amp; Clank universe allowed us to create a heartfelt story about friendship and overcoming all odds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Looking at the evolution, from the PS2 console in my dorm room on a 13&#8243; screen TV &#8211; to now Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart &#8211; in glorious 4K HDR* with ray-traced reflections and 3D audio in my headphones, it&#8217;s been amazing to see the way two best friends have evolved right alongside the console.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For those of you who have been fans over the years &#8211; you&#8217;ll notice a lot of easter eggs in the video. Swag and rare Ratchet &amp; Clank artifacts dot the rooms, many of these items come from my personal Ratchet &amp; Clank collection. Several more are props from the original TV commercials for the PS2 console (though they have been shrunken a bit for this video!). You might even see some glimpses of toys from other IP that Insomniac Games has created and developed during those timeframes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One of the things that is most staggering to me about the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise is that it is coming up on its 20th Anniversary in 2022. Ratchet and Clank are some of PlayStation&#8217;s greatest heroes, having debuted on the PlayStation 2 console in 2002, and grown up right alongside the consoles. Many of you have grown up alongside them.&nbsp; We can\u2019t wait to celebrate the 20th Anniversary next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-default-font\">And while I can&#8217;t hook you up with all my cool Ratchet &amp; Clank toys &#8211; we do have some new ways for you to show your love for the franchise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-default-font\">We have some brand-new face filters for Instagram and Facebook stories.

The PlayStation VR Aim Controller really opened our eyes to how far we could go with the realism of using a sniper rifle. When you lift the Aim and steady yourself to fire, you find yourself holding your breath and squeezing the trigger slowly. It&#8217;s not just about playing the role of a sniper, it actually helps you to land that first shot on target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There were many technical challenges to overcome. It is, after all, adding a third camera to the rendering demands of the game. But, with some clever tricks assisted by the console&#8217;s horsepower, we&#8217;ve created the seamless, immersive and natural feeling of using a real, physical sniper scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With the PS Move controllers, you&#8217;ll manually feed a new clip of ammo and action the bolt of a Carcano rifle or slap a fresh magazine into a Sten &#8212; or, if John Woo is more your style, dual-wield a pair of Colt 1911s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Sniper Elite&#8217;s defining signature moment is the iconic X-Ray cam. There was never any doubt that we would need to bring it to VR and that it would have to express all the punch and power of the original. It took a lot of fine tuning but I&#8217;m happy to report that we have succeeded. Like a lot of things in VR, you&#8217;ll have to see it for yourself before you believe it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395235_ff21d778da_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395235_ff21d778da_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Sniper Elite VR\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Free movement is the third pillar of the Sniper Elite series. The tactical options that open up when you can pick your own path through the enemy, sneak to an overlook position or sprint for cover when things go loud demanded that we step away from the &#8216;on rails&#8217; gameplay of some VR shooters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">That has required that we support a suite of movement and comfort options. Sniper Elite VR allows you to customize many aspects of the movement system including free movement, single stick teleport and facing input and individual control over the position of inventory interact points and hand offsets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395330_5b7ba8d335_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395330_5b7ba8d335_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Sniper Elite VR\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The combined VR development experience of the three studios working on Sniper Elite VR has been brought to bear to create an experience for players at all comfort level preferences without compromising the thrilling sensations of the gameplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rebellion is a strong believer in virtual reality as a platform for creating unique gaming experiences. We were part of the first group of studios to deliver a release title for PS VR with Battlezone Gold and the principles that informed the development of that game; that it should be a full AAA game that exploits the unique qualities of VR, remain true for Sniper Elite VR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395375_f35b26b9ae_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219395375_f35b26b9ae_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Sniper Elite VR\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If you&#8217;re a fan of the Sniper Elite series or are coming to it for the first time, you are going to get an explosive and exhilarating experience that will challenge you and keep you coming back for more.

You\u2019ll be able to freely move (with 1:1 accuracy) throughout the level, whether that be on-foot, whilst climbing, on a zipline, or whilst hurtling down a mountain on your skis. The fluid action also provides you with cover shooter mechanics, giving you the freedom to intuitively grab environmental objects and use them to your advantage. On-foot movement is both instinctive and fast-paced. Aim your PlayStation Move controller in the direction you want to travel in (there\u2019s absolutely no teleportation here).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Interactive and Special Weapons<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Interactive and Special Weapons\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/niftythriftyasiaticgreaterfreshwaterclam#?secret=KCBKJWGWyp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Yes, there\u2019s a shotgun! This punch-packing firearm is just one of the special weapons that will help you take on the hive of interdimensional enemies infesting the mountainous fracking community. You\u2019ll also have noticed the SMG, which requires you to grab a new magazine and cock the weapon to fire (just like our pistol). This immersive mechanic not only helps you feel the action, but it also adds a new dimension to gunplay.

Whilst a lot of this is directly driven by the gameplay and interactions you undertake; we took the bold decision to provide you with a voiced protagonist, providing a role-playing experience where you can <em>become<\/em> the hero by stepping into the role. Not only that, but as the ex-Special Forces hero in Fracked, you won\u2019t be going it alone &#8212; you\u2019ve got backup!

With Fracked, we wanted to offer something more, a game that shows off the verticality of the virtual environment. The levels and world have been designed with this in mind, throwing you into the midst of imposing mountains, steep ski slopes, bottomless mine shafts, and the imposing corrugated steel behemoths of industry. Whilst on foot, you\u2019ll be running, climbing, and ziplining through each level, all in a single seamless, action-focused experience.

This is not your typical sunny LA though; in After the Fall, all of hell has frozen over and LA has been left in ice-covered ruins. Set nearly 20 years after the apocalypse, the city is overrun with ferocious, once-human creatures called the Snowbreed that have driven humanity below ground, where they continue a raging fight for survival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You, the player, are a Harvest Runner, one of the few who are courageous enough to venture out into the cold. With your squad of fellow Runners you\u2019ll jump into the containment sites that are filled to the brim with Snowbreed. People in the various settlements in LA rely on you to enter these monster infested zones in order to bring in the resources required to keep the lights on back at the Line. In return, you are rewarded with bigger and better guns to go back in for this satisfying loop of taking out Snowbreed. It\u2019s not an easy job, and only Harvest Runners can tackle the different dangers that these Snowbreed embody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Special Snowbreed<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As you might know from my blog post for the previous PS VR Spotlight last March, there are several ferocious snowbreed who are looking to feast on you. Now I\u2019d like to give you a closer look at some of the more mutated types you\u2019ll face in the frozen apocalyptic wasteland to get you prepared for battle:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247465_1e18aed627_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247465_1e18aed627_h.jpg\" alt=\"After The Fall\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>The Eater <\/strong>is an enormous, revolting Snowbreed type that will annihilate everything in its path if it explodes. Your best chance against this terrifying creature is to keep your distance and have a precise aim whenever he\u2019s getting too close.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247425_3369f41153_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247425_3369f41153_h.jpg\" alt=\"After The Fall\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>The Juggernaut <\/strong>is different from the regular Snowbreed. This hulking slab of undead muscle only has one goal: to grab and pummel you into dust. Getting hit by him is a 1-hit KO, so listen to your team and keep an eye out for him; it\u2019s a high-priority target on your list!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208468102_cd521f1e63_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208468102_cd521f1e63_h.jpg\" alt=\"After The Fall\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>The Smasher <\/strong>is large and highly aggressive. When these guys show up, you\u2019d better steer clear and really work together to take them out. As you progress, you\u2019ll encounter more versions of the Smasher, but that\u2019s all I can say for now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Now that you know more about the monsters that will be awaiting you, the next question on your mind is surely how we will help you take them out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In After the Fall, it is all about knowing your enemies and working together with your team in order to survive. Your next best friend is your large arsenal of weapons. This consists of a variety of handguns, shotguns, rifles and more, and as you get more experienced as a Runner, higher quality variations will become available to you. It is up to you to use these weapons wisely. Only one thing is certain; whether you rush to the frontlines with your custom handgun ready, or stay back with your hunting rifle and explosives, do not run out of ammo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247405_c233ba165e_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210247405_c233ba165e_h.jpg\" alt=\"After The Fall\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You\u2019ll get to craft weapons while engaging in the game\u2019s high-paced combat using real-life movements. Customizing weapons and gear requires resources and floppy disk blueprints found throughout the city, so you\u2019ll have to scavenge the remains of civilization in order to stay ahead of your enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We\u2019ve only shown you the tip of the iceberg, and there will be more information on After the Fall in the near future.

You pause for a brief moment and gaze upon the barren and dusty hills in front of you. Will you be able to restore life in this world and stop the upcoming Cataclysm? Only time will tell as you make your forests grow, one tree at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/charmingfreedove#?secret=SM8IPr5kAA' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>The Gardener&#8217;s Bond<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As the Gardener, you share a special bond with the trees. You need their life-giving energy to roam the land as much as they need you to thrive in the diverse environments of each region. Each forest you plant becomes a safe haven to serve as starting points for your exploration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/glamorousimprobablegalapagosalbatross#?secret=qtWip516CW' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">At the edges of the world lie the Outposts, tall ancient structures built by ancient gardeners. Find your way towards them as you earn new fruits allowing you to match the different soils on the road. Awakening the Outposts will uncover ancient knowledge resulting in new abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/whichimpureiberianmidwifetoad#?secret=hjeFUkrKdE' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As you explore, you will stumble across new biomes with ground conditions for which no exact species in your fruit pouch will fit. Take a moment to analyze your options. If two or three different fruits put together would match the surrounding environment, you have the power to combine them and create a new variety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/entireringedanteater#?secret=y5bnZg3xbp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Weather and forests<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In your journey, you will encounter changing weather conditions in some of the regions. A relatively dry hill can be traversed by a raining cloud and the trees on that hill will suffer from a level of humidity that is above their desired nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/unknowneachgoitered#?secret=hKQT7w3rUQ' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Similar to the Gardener&#8217;s bond with the forest as a whole, trees themselves support each other. If a tree is less adapted to the current conditions, a well-adapted one growing nearby will help it survive. You can have a glimpse of the friendly bond between trees if you walk around the forest during nighttime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/thankfulsoftitaliangreyhound#?secret=YmY581f5C1' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Make sure to mix different trees to create enduring forests that will survive a passing storm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>The Garden: a private herbarium<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">At the heart of the Steppe, you will often traverse the central hub: the Garden. At its center lies the Panemona, the key to the Steppe&#8217;s survival. Each time you awaken a new Ark, a corresponding tree will grow in the Garden and the Panemona&#8217;s vegetation will progress. The lifegiving nature of the Garden can make any tree species thrive in its soil. You can use this peaceful patch of land as your own private garden, planting any tree there will yield you a constant supply of its kind of fruit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/magnificentcommondoe#?secret=nA7hcjqdPS' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In the Garden, you will also notice the herbariums, wooden gates highlighting the entrance to each of the Steppe&#8217;s regions. The herbariums are bound by the vegetal signature of their corresponding region: you will be able to see what climate conditions you&#8217;ll encounter in your travels as well as track your progress in each one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Wind &amp; Leaves\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/calculatingfairgreathornedowl#?secret=6OMLFEJYzP' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are to discover the world of Winds &amp; Leaves when it comes out this summer!

And accompanying that visual showcase was the alluring yet all-too short debut of some of the game\u2019s soundtrack. Today, we get to linger on that score.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Firstly, the chance to absorb four tracks from that State of Play demo in isolation, forming The Isle of Spires EP that\u2019s just released onto streaming services &#8211;<a href=\"https:\/\/soundtracks.lnk.to\/horizonFW\"> listen to it here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Secondly, we\u2019re excited to reveal the composers behind the music of Horizon Forbidden West. Joris de Man, Niels van de Leest and composing duo The Flight all return from Horizon Zero Dawn, and are joined on the sequel by Oleksa Lozowchuk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To mark the EP\u2019s release, and share the first details of what players should expect from them for Horizon Forbidden West, we brought the composers and Guerrilla Music Supervisor Lucas Van Tol together for a roundtable discussion. That wide-ranging chat tackles amongst other things, the challenges of building upon what went before, deciding who worked on what (\u201cwe have a lot more music than in Horizon Zero Dawn,\u201d Van Tol explains of the necessity) and individual approaches to composing (fun fact: one composer builds their own instruments). But first, introductions:<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"usMBLiFwcko\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/usMBLiFwcko\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"The music of Horizon Forbidden West: meet the composers\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Getting the band back together&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Consideration for the sequel\u2019s music began \u201csince the moment we knew there would be [one],\u201d jokes Van Tol.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Guerrilla\u2019s Music Supervisor is credited not only with defining which aspects of Horizon Forbidden West\u2019s music each of the four composers would work on but keeping track of everything. Creating the sequel\u2019s open world soundscape &#8211; covering but not limited to tribes, characters, enemies, locations, cues &#8211; as well as evolving it from what came before was understandably a herculean undertaking. It made sense to split and divide. Van Tol played both ringmaster and conductor, briefing and guiding the group throughout production. He also wanted a different approach to the game\u2019s score. \u201dIn Horizon Zero Dawn our initial focus was on locations,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis time around we wanted to follow the story a lot more closely and create a more fluent and emotional experience, also outside of the cutscenes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">That previous collaboration helped the studio decide the best way forward. The Flight\u2019s Alexis Smith notes that Van Tol gained valuable insight as to each composer\u2019s sounds and strengths: \u201cHe usually has a pretty good view on which parts he wants us to compose.\u201d So Joris de Man worked on emotional cues \u201cthat weren\u2019t specifically linked to an area\u201d, while as with the original, Niels van der Leest handled percussive music for specific events like hunting and music for every tribal region in the game. There were exceptions: character arcs, including key cinematics and quests were wholly owned by a single composer, ensuring thematic continuity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Oleksa Lozowchuk\u2019s remit was more extensive, covering \u201call types.\u201d \u201cThat really helped me develop a stronger sense of how the different types of music dovetailed with each other, weaving in and out through the game arc.\u201d By all accounts, he had an ear for this world from the start. Lozowchuk, an industry veteran who worked at Capcom Vancouver for over seven years, joined the composing roster after impressing the team with his audition pieces.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">That said, he kept checking the other composers\u2019 work periodically to make sure there was cohesion. As did the rest; stationed as they are in different countries around the world, group calls and a shared cloud drive were the quickest ways to check in. These offered guidance, and during enforced breaks due to Covid (\u201cwe just moved our rigs home and carried on from there,\u201d remembers Alexis) a chance to connect with peers. Sharing also led to unexpected collaborations. \u201cThe Flight ended up reusing and remixing my vocal assets from one of the 9-part choral pieces I wrote for one of the game\u2019s tribes,\u201d remembers Oleksa. \u201cThey used it in their own way to flesh out another scene in an entirely different context of the game.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51221400845_ae80fca2ef_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51221400845_ae80fca2ef_o.png\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Horizon Forbidden West\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Meet the musicians behind Horizon Forbidden West. From left to right: composer duo The Flight (Alexis Smith, Joe Henson), Guerrilla Audio Lead Bastian Seelbach, Guerrilla Music Supervisor Lucas Van Tol, and composers Oleksa Lozowchuk, Niels van der Leest and Joris de Man.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Familiar themes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Lozowchuk first fully immersed himself in the original\u2019s soundtrack to get into the mindset of Aloy\u2019s world, then set out to \u201ccompliment and contour\u201d what had come before, building variations and fragments of previous themes, while also creating new emotional beats for players. He wasn\u2019t alone. The Flight loaded up original recording sessions to remind themselves of the process, while Joris de Man looked back on his own pieces to \u201cfigure out what made those tracks work\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">All tease that we\u2019ll hear returning themes from the original. Aloy\u2019s Theme is one, \u201calbeit adapted to the new game,\u201d confirms de Man. With that track capturing Aloy\u2019s growing confidence over the course of the first game, how can they evolve further yet retain that familiar resonance? \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of the most interesting aspects of [this sequel] for me,\u201d he responds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For him and the other returning composers, they were eager to find new additions to layer onto a world the musical DNA of which they defined. \u201cWe were aware this was new sonic territory, it couldn\u2019t be retread of the previous game,\u201d de Man admits of the challenge ahead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">They all looked to both the real world and Aloy\u2019s for inspiration. \u201cYou read up on the backstory of the part of Horizon Forbidden West\u2019s world you\u2019re working on,\u201d van der Leest outlines as his way back in. \u201cTry and find similarities with our own (musical) history and then distil from that to create something new.\u201d Oleksa feels the team has found a great balance of interweaving returning music and new score. \u201cYou never want to alienate those who love the first game, but want to give them plenty to explore and journey through for the sequel.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207430368_4500caf199_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207430368_4500caf199_h.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon Forbidden West\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Finding the new sound<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Was anything off limits, or felt ill-fitting for the game\u2019s sonic palette? Once again, all point to Lucas Van Tol keeping everyone on the right track. \u201cHe could give us feedback when we submitted pieces, such as \u2018don\u2019t use this instrument, as that\u2019s linked to this tribe\u2019,\u201d outlines de Man. \u201c\u2018Use some of these textures or listen to what one of the other composers has done to get the right vibe for this area\u2019.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The composer elaborates further. \u201cThe key focus was to come up with organic textures and sounds, that fit the aesthetic of the Horizon Forbidden West game world, whilst upgrading it from the sound that Horizon Zero Dawn was based on; that means that there\u2019s a bit more synthesizer work and synthetic textures complementing the organic tones than there was in the previous game.\u201d For van der Leest, he always keeps our protagonist in mind. \u201cThe key theme for me was to always see the world through the eyes of Aloy. She is once again set with a difficult task which influences the way she looks at the world around her.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One interesting fact pops up off the back of the question: alongside tracking down little-known instruments and researching which would fit each tribe, Niels van der Leest further immersed himself in Aloy\u2019s world by building his own. \u201dThe people in that world don\u2019t have any recollection of our society,\u201d he reasons. \u201cAs such they are creating their instruments from scratch and in many cases unlike anything from what you\u2019ve seen in our world.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Everyone\u2019s creative process is different. Joris de Man noodles with a piano or tries some unique tricks, such as a plectrum on a violin with paper stuck between the strings (\u201cwhy not?\u201d). He talks of his palette being more grittier and raw this time round, a style to reflect the Forbidden West, \u201ca more dangerous area with more uncertainty ahead\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Van der Leest takes a \u2018day off\u2019 from the studio and his keyboard to ensure a clean slate before starting to track a new region. The Flight cover their workspace in visuals of their subject matter to inspire experimentation. Oleksa rattles off an eye-widening list of instruments, including organic sources, indigenous percussion instruments and synthetic sources that he\u2019s using to build his corner of the world. \u201cI try to listen to the ebb and flow of energy that passes through all the melodies, harmonies and textures at different listening levels, making sure it still keeps my attention until I simply hit a point of saturation. Once I&#8217;ve heard enough to release it I can move on.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208293245_a720da81cc_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208293245_a720da81cc_h.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon Forbidden West\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">A soundtrack unlike any other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m proud of that the composing team achieved on Horizon Zero Dawn was that the music seemed to be a natural fit \u2013 people listened to it and thought \u2018of course it\u2019s supposed to sound like that, this feels like a natural part of Horizon\u2019s world\u2019,\u201d says Joris de Man about their success in forging a distinct soundscape back in 2017. Van der Leest is equally emphatic. \u201cThis was one of the most exciting parts of creating the music. Creating a sound that somehow sounded familiar but one you couldn\u2019t necessarily put your finger on. Sure there are instruments that you\u2019d recognize, but the combination with other more unworldly instruments and electronics made them sound new and fresh.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For the original game, the approach was to create a soundtrack unlike anything players had heard before. The composers have kept that in mind for the sequel. \u201cSame vein, but different,\u201d Alexis intriguingly says of the throughline between original and this latest work. Oleksa calls the results \u201csonic alchemy\u201d. \u201cOn this project, I got human voices to create non-human sounds and acoustic instruments to approximate human voices and phrasing.\u201d All have been invigorated at the chance to step back into this world and grow its soundscape. Niels van der Leest sums it up best: \u201cHorizon Forbidden West is a special project as it challenges you to think outside of the box the whole time. Making the music for this game is a unique experience.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"Lq594XmpPBg\"

This is a very exciting time for the team, and we are very much looking forward to this next chapter. We wanted to take this chance to thank all of you, the PlayStation fans, for your kind words of support over the years, especially since Astro made its big debut on PlayStation 5 alongside the DualSense wireless controller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While we are growing and challenging bigger things, our mission at heart remains the same as ever: bring you PlayStation magic, innovation and put smiles on your faces with fun, colorful games for all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To go alongside this news, we are proud to show our new logo which you will see in our future productions. We took inspiration from what Team Asobi meant to us. Some of the old-timers might recognize other influences from the PlayStation early days as well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To keep in touch, we are also launching our own social channels on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/teamasobi?lang=en\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/teamasobi\/\">Instagram<\/a> to keep you updated on all things Team Asobi! Please follow them and don\u2019t hesitate to engage with us.&nbsp; We have a million anecdotes to share about the making of our games so please come and say hi!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219612048_ea1193ad59_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51219612048_ea1193ad59_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Team Asobi\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And in case you are not familiar with Team Asobi, let us tell you more about our origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The team was first assembled in 2012, a bit more than a year before the launch of PS4. Back then, a handful of us were working away on tech demos showcasing what the new hardware could do. We sat down one day and decided we needed a name for our team; something that would work as a reminder to us of what we believed to be the most important part in any video game: great gameplay and that second-to-second enjoyment it can provide!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Japanese language, the word \u201cAsobu\u201d literally means \u201cTo Play\u201d and so we settled on \u201cAsobi &#8220;. Those simple five letters were a surprisingly fitting name with a good sound to it and it stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Fast-forward a few years, the team is still expanding, we launched Astro Bot: Rescue Mission in 2018 and Astro\u2019s Playroom for PS5 in 2020. And now, Team Asobi has become the newest internal studio within the PlayStation Studios family. At the heart, our philosophy revolves around that quintessential joy in <em>play<\/em>, be it through pixel-precise character controls, exploiting a cool new controller in surprising ways or packing humorous animations in every nook and cranny, this is the stuff that excites us :)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">So, who are the Asobis then? Well, since we are a PlayStation game development studio located in the cool and vibrant Tokyo, the majority of the team are Japanese. We also have several members coming from various other countries: England, Germany, France, Scotland, Korea, Spain, and Colombia. It\u2019s important for us to have this mixed background to help us create games that are universal. And of course, we all share that same love for Japan: its craft, its pop culture, its gaming heritage but also its beautiful seasons, wacky innovations (so many!!) and delicious food!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Technology has also been a defining factor for Team Asobi. Many Asobis have a real love affair with tech but we also realize that technology in itself is only the starting point. It then needs to be turned into something magical and awe-inspiring to be really meaningful. In that respect, working with the DualSense controller as of late has been great fun and we are continuing to enjoy experimenting with it at this very moment. But shhh it\u2019s a secret!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Finally, we inspire from crafted video games and all of Team Asobi members are keen gamers. We love all types of games including, of course, platformers that deliver that second-to-second joy where every single successful jump you make is a mini story in itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">That\u2019s all from us today. Let\u2019s face it, the last 18 months have been really tough for many people around the world and we sincerely hope that through the joy of <em>play,<\/em> these hard times were made easier to bear. We would like to send you all our biggest wishes of well-being. Thank you for being such a great community and we look forward to your comments. See you all very soon!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everybody, we hope you are all doing well and keeping healthy.

I\u2019m Ross, one of the designers here at Lucid Games. It\u2019s been awesome seeing everyone diving into Destruction AllStars and smashing each other to pieces with our 17 AllStars. I\u2019ve been having a great time jumping into the game myself and wrecking along with the community. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2021\/05\/05\/jump-back-into-the-arena-destruction-allstars-first-post-launch-season-today\/\">Our first season<\/a> is well underway and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2021\/05\/19\/capture-and-share-every-glorious-wreck-with-the-new-photo-mode-in-destruction-allstars\/\">you\u2019ve been capturing every second of the action with Photo Mode<\/a>! I\u2019ve had a blast seeing what you\u2019ve been posting on social media, so much so that I had to pick out a few of my favourites to share below.<br><br>Today we\u2019re celebrating the launch of Blitz, our brand new game mode in Destruction AllStars, and I wanted to give you all a closer look at the game mode and dive into some of our design goals and aspirations for the mode. I\u2019ll also throw in a few cheeky tips to help give you a headstart in our new premiere game mode! (If you\u2019re new to our arena of destruction, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2021\/02\/02\/destruction-allstars-launch-day-tips-7-tips-to-wreck-your-way-to-victory\/\">you can get a primer right here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Destruction AllStars\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/snappybriskasiaticmouflon#?secret=UcB0XoH5Cg' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Blitz and Glamor<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Our new game mode, Blitz, is a highly competitive, multi-team version of Mayhem which uses rounds and a slightly modified scoring system to reward teamwork and precision. It encourages players to capitalise on well thought out, coordinated attacks rather than simply driving, smashing and evading. It\u2019ll bring new skill based rewards for you to earn and show off to the community, just so they know who came out on top. We&#8217;ve been playing a lot of Blitz at Lucid for a while now and having loads of fun with it, so I really think you&#8217;re gonna have a blast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Destruction AllStars\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/elderlygreedyfieldmouse#?secret=CHGo6rN2kC' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">From the ground up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When starting out with this kind of mode, we knew that we wanted to create something which uses the core game mechanics and what people enjoy about Mayhem, but create a highly competitive, intense and fast-paced game mode that rewards team focused play. To achieve this, we knew we had to inject various forms of teamplay into Blitz, whether it be understanding which team member should choose a specific AllStar, driving as a pack to hunt the same opponents or avenging the wreck of a teammate by wrecking an enemy player. Overall, we wanted to tone down some of the noise and allow for calculated, precision gameplay whilst enabling you to stay tuned in to how a game was progressing between multiple teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To accomplish this, we made the decision to have a maximum of 12 players in a game of Blitz. Splitting those 12 into four teams of three AllStars helped give more weight to your choice of AllStar throughout a match. Each match is split into rounds where teams battle it out to be the first team to score 100 points, or have the highest points when the timer runs out. Scoring points should feel very familiar with hits, barges, wrecks and KOs being a reliable way to climb the scoreboard. The first team to win two rounds will win the match, so there\u2019s no need to worry if you feel like you\u2019ve fallen too far behind, one good round puts you right back up there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Along with its round-based system, what really sets Blitz apart is character lockouts and ability energy carry over. With character lockouts, you need to pick a new AllStar at the start of every round. Once you\u2019ve used an AllStar, you can\u2019t pick them again for the rest of the match. This means you\u2019ll be using anywhere from two to five different AllStars in a game of Blitz, depending on how many rounds are played. We feel this makes you think more about your team composition. Do you use your main in the first round or save it for a comeback in round four? Another factor to consider is that your ability charge for your Breaker and Hero Vehicle also carry over between rounds. If you earn your Hero Vehicle in round one, will you deploy it asap to secure the win or save it to start round two with a decisive advantage?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Destruction AllStars\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/shockedweepyaustralianfreshwatercrocodile#?secret=ZhPiAlKH3o' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Injecting depth into Blitz<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once we had the early versions of Blitz up and running, we quickly began to dig a little deeper to see what we could include to help separate the good teams from the best teams. Team takedowns are a way to earn bonus points by working together to wreck an enemy player. The more players working together on this, the more you score. Communication can be a great way to plan this kind of an attack, but you can also keep things simple and follow your teammates around the arena. If you see them deploy a breaker or charge a specific vehicle, you can sweep in with an assist for a team takedown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">On the opposite side, the vengeance system is a great way to earn bonus points as you react to one of your teammates being wrecked or KO\u2019d. After this happens to any player, their team gets 30 seconds to get a vengeance wreck or KO on the attacker and earn some bonus points for their team. Keep a close eye on the kill feed and on the display to know which players you should be targeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rounds can be won or lost at the character select screen. Picking a lineup of AllStars that work well together can help secure team takedowns with coordinated use of their abilities. For example, if you pick Jian and use their breaker to drop mines around the arena and easily tag several enemy players, a team mate could follow up with Sgt. Rescue\u2019s Hero Vehicle, which has a lot of weight and health, and wreck some of those vehicles for bonus points! You can combine this with your ability energy that carries over between rounds. If your Hero Vehicle is ready, you can pick an AllStar with a Hero Vehicle that hits hard and start strong in the next round. Or, if you\u2019re out of energy, you could pick an AllStar with a strong on-foot breaker to support your teammates. All in all, there\u2019s lots of team compositions to experiment with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Rewards<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There are unique rewards to earn in Blitz as part of Season One Hotshots. Every week, one of your weekly challenges will ask you to play Blitz and will offer an additional reward, a Blitz-themed skin for an AllStar. We\u2019ve also added two new sponsor challenges for you to complete, each rewarding an avatar and banner set. These challenges are based on winning games of Blitz, so they can be a way to really show off your skills to other players! Alongside these rewards, regular XP and Season Points systems work in Blitz and you can complete some of your daily and weekly challenges in Blitz, just like any other game mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Destruction AllStars\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/necessaryvelvetylark#?secret=qvRT2iCwGO' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Good luck in the Arena<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Just to pass on a few hints and tips from our playtests at Lucid&#8230; don\u2019t play with Gerard, he\u2019s a great producer but rubbish at Blitz. As for more practical tips&#8230; choose your targets carefully to earn bonus score wherever possible, do you really want to deploy your Hero Vehicles ability for that target or is there a revenge wreck you could go for further down the arena? Also, choose the right AllStar for the right round, but this can be a deeply personal choice. Do you pick your favourite AllStar early on to really set the tone for a match or will you save them for a future round? It&#8217;s all about matching your picks to your playstyle and finding your rhythm, as well as countering how the enemy teams are playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It\u2019s really great to see Blitz going live today in Destruction AllStars! I know lots of the team at Lucid will be watching social media to see how you all get on in its first week as well as jumping in ourselves to get hands on with the community. Hopefully we\u2019ll see loads of communication start to form as players harness this type of teamplay to really capitalise on score. I\u2019m also hoping to see a few epic games where each team wins a round so it takes it to a fifth and final round where it&#8217;s all to play for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">This is only the beginning for Blitz as it\u2019s been designed with competitive play and a ranking system in mind. Whilst it\u2019s launching today as an unranked playlist, we\u2019re planning on releasing a ranked mode some time in the future. We\u2019re not quite ready to talk details on that just yet, but you can expect ranks to progress through and exclusive rewards tied to which rank you achieve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">So there you have it. It&#8217;s been an exciting challenge for us to bring the first brand new game mode to Destruction AllStars since its launch, but we think we\u2019ve really hit the nail on the head with Blitz in delivering a fast-paced, competitive experience as well as adding in new tactical layers for player skill to really shine! I can&#8217;t wait to hear what you all think of the mode, we&#8217;ve really enjoyed building it, and I know I speak for the team when saying we look forward to playing along with you guys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Blitz is now live in Destruction AllStars!

Single-player, narrative-driven games &#8212; that\u2019s our DNA. PlayStation Studios have made, in my mind, some of the most memorable narrative experiences available. We love making them, and we\u2019ll keep making them as long as gamers enjoy them. For me, the idea of sitting down on a Friday night with a brand-new world, and a great story to explore &#8212; that sounds pretty perfect, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also want to make sure that we\u2019re creating a variety of experiences for our audiences. Franchises, new IP, big games, smaller and more innovative games, single-player stories, and multiplayer. Who says that multiplayer experience cannot have great stories, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: We\u2019ve seen the announcement of Haven, from Jade Raymond as well as a bunch of industry veterans. And more recently Firewalk, which also has some top names from the industry.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>How do you see partnerships like these fitting into the larger PlayStation Studios vision?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: Yeah. You know, these partnerships are very exciting. You could, I guess, make a distinction between development teams who are part of Sony &#8212; like Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Media Molecule, Sucker Punch, and so on &#8212; and then development teams who are working with us like partners&#8230; Haven, Firewalk, but also teams we\u2019ve worked with over years, like Kojima Productions, From Software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To me, in many ways, there really is no difference. They\u2019re all PlayStation Studios. We are, at the end of the day, a creator-led organization. Which to me means that we want to find the best possible development studios in the world and help them passionately pursue their ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To me, it\u2019s important that PlayStation Studios is a place that allows creators to join us and do the best work of their career. That\u2019s really what I\u2019m after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u2026.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: Are you able to give us a snapshot of the total number of titles that PlayStation Studios are currently developing for PS4 or PS5?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: Well, we have a lot going on right now. PlayStation Studios have more than 25 titles in development. Almost half of these are new IP. The other half, they\u2019re titles that are set in franchises that PlayStation fans already know and love. So, it\u2019s quite a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: How important is new IP for PlayStation Studios?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: New IP is incredibly important to us. New IP is the lifeblood of gaming. But, new IP is just one aspect of our strategy. Ultimately, I want PlayStation Studios to be fiercely daring, to take risks. I want us to continue to embrace the legacy of PlayStation, pushing the boundaries of gaming, keep making games that matter. Games that, probably, wouldn\u2019t have been made anywhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And you know, Bend Studio is working on a very exciting new IP that they\u2019re very, very passionate about. They\u2019re building on the deep open-world systems that they developed with Days Gone. So I\u2019m really happy for Bend Studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: How have the teams at PlayStation Studios been able to cope and adapt with these big challenges over the last year?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: Perhaps the biggest challenge has been when we need specialist locations, often physical locations. Primarily performance capture, audio work. We\u2019ve come up with some really clever solutions to some of this, we built tiny recording studios in people\u2019s houses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But when you\u2019re doing performance capture for a lot of cinematics, with multiple actors &#8212; that\u2019s not so simple to solve. So you\u2019ve got a choice. You could do it later in the schedule, which could cause you problems. Or you could risk the final quality by doing it in a different way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But I can tell you, we\u2019re not going to risk the quality. We want to ship extremely high quality games, finished games, and we have to do that obviously without pushing our teams to the breaking point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">So we have, currently, two very big, very narrative-driven games in development: Horizon Forbidden West and the next God of War. And for both of those, they\u2019re frankly affected by access to performance capture and talent. For Horizon, we think we are on track to release this holiday season. But that isn\u2019t quite certain yet, and we\u2019re working as hard as we can to confirm that to you as soon as we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And for God of War, the project started a little later. So we\u2019ve made the decision to push that game out to next year, to ensure that Santa Monica Studio can deliver the amazing God of War game that we all want to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With these things, something\u2019s gotta give. It cannot be the quality of our titles, and it surely won\u2019t be the health or the wellbeing of our amazing team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: How does PS4 factor into PlayStation Studios\u2019 development vision? Is it still a focus internally for future game development?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: It very much is. You can\u2019t build a community of over 110 million PS4 owners and then just walk away from it, right? I think that\u2019d be bad news for fans of PS4, and frankly not very good business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Where it makes sense to develop a title for both PS4 and PS5 &#8212; for Horizon Forbidden West, the next God of War, GT7 &#8212; we\u2019ll continue looking at that. And if PS4 owners want to play that game, then they can. If they want to go on and play the PS5 version, that game will be there for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">That being said, it\u2019s also very important to have showpieces for PS5, hence the development of Returnal and Ratchet that are exclusive to PS5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: [How does] PC fit into the worldview of PlayStation Studios moving forward?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: We\u2019re still early on in our planning for PC. And Horizon Zero Dawn has been very successful. I think it shows there\u2019s an appetite from gamers outside the PlayStation ecosystem to experience the amazing portfolio of games that PlayStation fans have enjoyed for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But I want to emphasize that PlayStation will remain the best place to play our PlayStation Studios titles at launch. But we do value PC gamers, and we\u2019ll continue to look at the right times to launch each game. Bend Studio just released the PC version of Days Gone on May 18. So that\u2019s about two years after the PS4 release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And I hope that a new set of fans can and will enjoy that title. And that\u2019s the goal &#8212; we want to reach new gamers who haven\u2019t yet experienced the great stories, characters, and worlds that we\u2019ve built. Releasing games on PC will not come ever at the expense of building an exciting lineup of great console games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: Another topic that\u2019s been out there recently is Japan. Do you feel that, from the PlayStation Studios perspective, that Japan is still a big focus for development? Or are you maybe considering a shift to a more Western focus for game development?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hermen: Oh no, I want to be very clear that Japanese games and Japanese talent remain extremely important to PlayStation Studios and to Sony Interactive Entertainment. Japan and Asia are strongly associated with our legacy: the success of Sony, the PlayStation brand, and many of our iconic PlayStation franchises were actually born in that region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I remember watching the PlayStation 5 Showcase event from last year. It struck me how much Japanese influence there was in the games that we showed. And what a key part of PlayStation\u2019s DNA that is. It\u2019s one of the things that makes PlayStation different, unique in my mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I know the potential from high-quality games from Japan and Asia, and some of the best development talent in the world is found there. They have that history of innovation, of craftsmanship and skill, that pride and team spirit. We very much want to continue those traditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Polyphony Digital is such an important part of the PlayStation family, making the best driving simulation games in the world. We\u2019re building Team Asobi in Tokyo, a world-class studio that are developing a franchise for all ages with global appeal. Such a creative team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And alongside Asobi, we will continue to maintain and build partnerships through our external development team. So I\u2019m really excited about the future of PlayStation games from Japan, and Asia. And I\u2019m grateful for the interest and passionate support for our Japanese teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>PSB: Great to know.

Along with that &#8211; a selection of combat tips to help you survive the challenges awaiting Ryu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208401749_2ed85c4abb_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208401749_2ed85c4abb_b.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Arcade Archives Ninja Gaiden\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>The Origins of Ryu Hayabusa<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hayabusa first graced our screens back in the 1988 arcade game, Ninja Gaiden, donning his classic blue ninja costume (which he also wears at the beginning of Sigma). In this first outing, he travelled across America in a side-scrolling beat \u2018em up adventure to defeat an evil cult seeking to end the world. The game quickly became a hit across the world for its unforgiving white-knuckle gameplay, pushing players to bring their A-game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With the series\u2019 success, Hayabusa would go on to star in a variety of different home-console Ninja Gaiden releases, as well as appearing in the Dead Or Alive series where he became an ass-kicking mainstay, further rocketing his popularity as the ultimate ninja in video game lore.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Nearly 20 years after the arcade classic was released, Ninja Gaiden Sigma finally brought the brutally challenging gameplay to the 3D battlefield of PlayStation, making its long-awaited debut on the PlayStation 3. The developers of Team Ninja drew inspiration from popular action-adventure games and titles such as Onimusha, working by trial and error to come up with a unique identity for a modern 3D Ninja Gaiden experience. These games would challenge gamers with no-holds-barred fights, forcing them to improve their gameplay skills in order to progress \u2013 something very different from how the highly-difficult \u201cmasocore\u201d style games of today (such as the Nioh series), which provide various options aside from full-on combat to empower yourself. These modern Ninja Gaiden games set the trailblazing standard for stylish action games thanks to their merciless but rewarding difficulty level!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"X3JelQdJ7QI\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/X3JelQdJ7QI\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"Survive Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection with combat tips\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Combat Tips<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With the series requiring you to hone your skills to overcome the challenge, we thought it would be best to provide some tips and tricks to Ninja Gaiden veterans and newcomers alike, giving everyone a fighting chance with the collection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Spark-Wallrun\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/spectacularcalmafricanmolesnake#?secret=cN7j4u1d3i' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"\"><strong>Wall Running<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The ultimate ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, has incredible agility \u2013 allowing him to run along walls and jump between them to reach high-up locations. Be sure to get to grips with this ability early on in the collection, as it will allow you to efficiently re-position yourself in battle, as well as make it easy to reach secret locations to find unique items outside of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Spark-Flying-Swallow\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/horriblequickflamingo#?secret=FLemq77QbL' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"\"><strong>Flying Swallow<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Sometimes several enemies might ambush you all at once! A perfect way to wipe them out is to make use of the powerful \u2018Flying Swallow\u2019 technique. This ability allows Hayabusa to jump into the air and slash through several enemies quickly as he lands, in some cases decapitating those that stand in his way. Once you master this technique, you will be able to quickly recover and combine this with a flurry of other attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Spark-Guillotine\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/bruisedquarterlybrownbutterfly#?secret=YwI0CsdluP' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"\"><strong>Guillotine Throw<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One of Hayabusa\u2019s old-school techniques from the Ninja Gaiden arcade game, the Guillotine Throw, makes its way into these modern entries! This popular ability is incredibly strong and allows you to eliminate enemies faster by grabbing their neck and tossing them into the ground or a wall. This attack isn\u2019t only great at defeating enemies, but it is also a perfect way to move enemies around the battleground so that you have more breathing room when things get tough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Spark-Shuriken-Stun\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/gleefulnewapatosaur#?secret=zPUmYtCh2u' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"\"><strong>Shurikens<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As a \u201csuper ninja\u201d, Ryu Hayabusa is proficient with a wide range of different weaponry to help him on his adventure. One weapon type that plays an important role in battle, and is a ninja\u2019s weapon of choice, is the Shuriken. Not only can these projectile weapons briefly stun an enemy from afar and open them up to deliver the perfect blow, they can be used mid-combo to help lengthen the amount of attacks you can deliver to an enemy \u2013 creating unique possibilities in battle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">These tips should help you get to grips with every game in the collection! As you progress through each title, you will meet many powerful foes, but keep your wits about you fearless ninjas and you\u2019ll be able to overcome even the toughest of enemies.

Sprawling and dripping with atmosphere, the unique setting created the perfect challenge for our Level Design team to sink their teeth into.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cIf you\u2019ve played the Resident Evil series, you might know that the Raccoon City police station was originally a museum. Everything from the architecture to the art pieces are gorgeous,\u201d shares St\u00e9phanie Hellin, Dead by Daylight\u2019s Team Lead Level Artist. \u201cIt has its own flavor and mood that permeates the whole map and really shapes your experience playing the game.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218416931_649c1632ba_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218416931_649c1632ba_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dead by Daylight (Resident Evil)\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If you\u2019re a Dead by Daylight veteran and have been hungry to dive into a new map, you\u2019ll be happy to know the Raccoon City police station should keep you busy for a while to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThis is by far the biggest map we\u2019ve ever introduced into Dead by Daylight,\u201d says St\u00e9phanie. \u201cIt was a challenge specifically with the time we had to create it. While the setting is huge, each room has its own look and feels which makes the map easier to navigate. We can\u2019t wait to see how players adapt to this kind of layout and how both Killers and Survivors approach its opportunities and challenges.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While fans can expect a faithful recreation of the Raccoon City police station, they can also expect a few special twists to help merge the world of Resident Evil with Dead by Daylight\u2019s gameplay and storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cOur challenge was to make sure that both these worlds not only fit together, but complemented each other,\u201d continues St\u00e9phanie. \u201cWe needed to bring the essence of both games together in one map. Dead by Daylight\u2019s gameplay is very hide-and-seek, and so we had to create more exits, entrances, and adapt some of the spaces and level-art composition while still staying true to the source.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Dead by Daylight, Survivors like Jill and Leon will also find themselves dealing with an entirely new evil: The Entity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218629663_c5acde27f7_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51218629663_c5acde27f7_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dead by Daylight (Resident Evil)\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThe Entity is the essence of Dead by Daylight,\u201d adds St\u00e9phanie. \u201cOur partnership with Capcom gave us the opportunity to have the Entity be even more present in our map. It feeds off hatred, and with these worlds combined it\u2019s hungrier than ever. The Entity is rarely seen in our game, but here it surrounds you in the map at almost every turn \u2013 a perfect representation of the nightmare you\u2019ll get to experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>New Killer: Nemesis<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Now that you\u2019re up to speed on our new map, let\u2019s break down the new Killer who will be stalking its hallways: the Nemesis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"\"><strong>Nemesis Power: T-Virus<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The new Killer\u2019s power is the T-Virus, which causes extreme mutations and can be transferred to others.

Charge up, then unleash Tentacle Strike on a Survivor to afflict them with the Contaminated status effect. Contaminating a Survivor will make them easier to spot as they cough and vomit their way around the map. Hit a contaminated Survivor a second time and you\u2019ll damage their health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Survivors can cure themselves and their allies by injecting a vaccine found in Supply Cases (not Chests!) around the map.

Aim the rat at the enemy you want to attack and they\u2019ll feel 220 pounds of augmented flesh and steel slam into them within seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Necromunda\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/disloyalcelebratedayeaye#?secret=60gSy2ZITf' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While an enemy is being mauled by your mastiff, they\u2019ll be far too busy trying not to die to attack you, allowing you to deliver death in other directions as you see fit. Additionally, for as long as your hound is with you, you\u2019ll gain part of its senses, creating red highlights around enemies within a certain radius of your buddy. Summoning your mastiff works great as both a panic button and for strategically incapacitating and attacking selected enemies. As strong as your mastiff is, it will need to rest after attacking for a set amount of time, but can be summoned back when the ability is ready again. All of this can be improved with augments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Necromunda\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/keywelldocumentediberiannase#?secret=t9K3pyL1x7' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Just as with your own body, your mastiff can be upgraded at the Ripper Doc in Martyr\u2019s End, the game\u2019s hub area. A good boy deserves some Cranial Armour. With three major upgrade categories: Head, Body, and Paws, you\u2019ll have a range of technology to help keep your dog alive and killing. Increase speed with Bionic Paws, then upgrade to a Bionic Nose for some cyber-sniffing, increasing detection radius of enemies. Improve your mastiffs dodge, health, armour penetration, and more, creating a veritable machine of destruction (while remaining your best bud, of course). With each major upgrade, your hound will visibly go from flesh to metal. What it may lose in cuteness, it\u2019ll gain tenfold in killing ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Necromunda\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/idleexhaustedamethystgemclam#?secret=qifFPCyJoW' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this overview of the mastiff in Necromunda: Hired Gun.

Recruit a friend for free<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Given the two-player requirement, recruitment should be your first priority. Operation: Tango supports both cross-play and a Friend Pass, meaning you can invite a friend to play with you for free even if they play on a different platform. Simply ask your partner to download the Trial Version of the game, and then start a game together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Cooperation and fun are at the heart of the experience, so even the most casual gamers can jump in and tackle missions with you right away!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Operation: Tango\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/briefhandyleonberger#?secret=991WGKbvfm' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">2. Agent or hacker, there\u2019s no wrong choice&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once you\u2019ve recruited a friend, there\u2019s no need to fight over who takes on which role. The Agent and Hacker roles are both built from the ground up to be integral to the experience while delivering their own unique brand of awesome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You\u2019ll never be waiting around while the other player is having all the fun. Asymmetrical co-op is all about constant participation, and while the Agent may be \u201con the ground,\u201d the Hacker will find themselves in virtual locations that rival anything the real world dishes out with regards to danger or visual splendor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Operation: Tango\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/pointlesshalfbordercollie#?secret=VljK4Bydrk' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">3. Communication is key&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Remember, your partner can\u2019t see what you see, and vice-versa, so words are your most essential tool. Always try to speak freely, share details about your unique perspective, and talk through each challenge as if you were confronted with it in a real-life setting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Operation: Tango\u2019s puzzles rely as much on communication as they do on creative problem-solving. Whether you\u2019re describing abstract elements, giving directions, or trying to make sense of complex rule sets (while a timer counts down, no less), well-chosen words are the key to success, and sometimes the difference between life or death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210127634_93068d7cb9_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210127634_93068d7cb9_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Operation: Tango\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Your voice is the one thing that connects you.

Take on a collaborative mindset&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When you\u2019re part of a dynamic spy duo, you simply can\u2019t go it alone. Winning like a team means playing like a team.&nbsp; Embrace your reliance on your teammate, and be sure to thank them for their efforts. Always try to keep kindness and patience in ample supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Each obstacle you face is another opportunity to work better together, and there\u2019s nothing better than completing a mission with a partner whose infectious positive attitude keeps things light-hearted and fun during even the most stressful moments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Operation: Tango\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/sardonicbouncycrossbill#?secret=RbZdDwK8Tq' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">5.

With emotes, dynamic text, and the ability to alter whole AR environments, there is ample room for personal expression. For some pairs, good-natured trolling can be half the fun. Get creative!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Operation: Tango\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/craftygrizzledhairstreak#?secret=eZ18LoV2xx' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">6.

Operation: Tango\u2019s hint system is a button press away, and provides just enough guidance to inspire a new approach to finding a solution. Used with discretion, it\u2019s a great way to maximize your gaming session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210127294_6aa4ab343e_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210127294_6aa4ab343e_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Operation: Tango\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">7.

I\u2019m Adam Volker, creative director at Flight School Studio, the team behind the 2019 game Creature in the Well, a top-down, pinball-inspired, hack-and-slash dungeon crawler\u2026 or \u201cpinbrawler\u201d as we all lovingly called it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Published by MWM Interactive, our next title, Stonefly, a mech adventure game launches today (woohoo!) and I want to pull the curtain back on some behind-the-scenes tidbits we\u2019ve never shared before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">At Flight School Studio, we like to make things that feel a little weird and different. Storytelling and art are things that we love and we&#8217;re always trying new approaches to games to see what&#8217;s fun and exciting. Stonefly is definitely our next iteration exploring those ideas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You play as Annika Stonefly, a brilliant yet naive young inventor who sets out on her own journey after disappointing her father. The Stonefly family runs the local repair shop, working on mechs and because of Annika&#8217;s oversight, her father&#8217;s prized rig, Chrysa, is stolen by a thief in the middle of the night. Chasing the thief, Annika discovers a big fantastic world, that inspires her to invent new mech capabilities, all of which come in really handy when she encounters buggos out in the wilderness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Inventing a world<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191765_6d45450dd3_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191765_6d45450dd3_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Stonefly\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Annika&#8217;s story was inspired by the journey that many of us on the development team have had. Sometimes taking on a huge journey can be paralyzing, and Annika not knowing everything she is about to undertake is just what she needs to get started. Her determination and directness is really inspiring. As she ventures out into the woods, she takes notes of the people she meets, the creatures, and fauna. She uses all of it as inspiration and she funnels that creativity into upgrades and abilities for her mech. It is in her curiosity that she finds knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Stonefly | Acorn Corps Mechs\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/handsomesarcasticfennecfox#?secret=quoQaHCXoC' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Stonefly&#8217;s world, tiny people travel in mechs that glide along the wind and are composed of a few upgradable components: the hull, legs, and antenna. Annika is no stranger to how these mechs function and is constantly upgrading her\u2019s as you adventure through the game. Depending on how you play you\u2019ll be encouraging Ann to invent wind abilities, upgrade the utilities of the mech or find inspiration for cosmetic upgrades hidden throughout the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209886274_4050c78337_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209886274_4050c78337_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Stonefly\" width=\"80%\"><\/a><\/p><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209886239_6a6b79fa05_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209886239_6a6b79fa05_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Stonefly\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For example, after being slowed down by silken worm goo over and over Annika invents a similar ability for her mech that makes bugs move slowly while she gets the loot. And, for any fashionistas, you can also scan elements in the environment to change the color of your rig, or even come up with your own custom color scheme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Slug it out or bugger off<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Gathering resources to make those upgrades is where Stonefly gets <em>intense<\/em>. Out in the world, there are bugs who are hungry for the same resources you need. To harvest the minerals like Limodot and Fawnicle, you&#8217;ll have to shoo the bugs away so you can drop in and get the loot. Bug encounters inspire Annika to create new mech inventions so that throughout the game, you&#8217;ll not only get stronger but also develop new strategies for handling bugs and getting minerals before they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191470_a4527954c2_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191470_a4527954c2_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Stonefly\"><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191445_58937eb577_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51210191445_58937eb577_k.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Stonefly\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/51208717277_afb2cdb3bd.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-349682\" width=\"564\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/51208717277_afb2cdb3bd.jpg?resize=468%2C261&amp;zoom=1 468w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/51208717277_afb2cdb3bd.jpg?resize=468%2C261&amp;zoom=0.5 234w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/06\/51208717277_afb2cdb3bd.jpg?resize=468%2C261&amp;zoom=0.25 117w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Speaking of bugs, each bug type will require a slightly different defense and engagement strategy. They&#8217;re inspired by everything from slugs to rhinos (seriously check out the animation and design for the Horned Beetle). For example, early on, many bugs you encounter will crawl on the ground, but Star Spiders fly high into the air making it hard to gain an aerial advantage. You&#8217;ll need to dodge their spinning defense and time your moves just right to stun them then shoo them away. With some advanced tactical strategy, you can even pit bugs against one another. Each encounter will require you to deftly use your abilities and smarts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-25.59% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(76.78% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Stonefly | Horned Beetle Lunge Attack\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/whoppingcrazyleopard#?secret=6XziPMeHQT' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And, keep in mind, bugs won&#8217;t want to attack you unless minerals are around and you&#8217;re a threat: that&#8217;s when they&#8217;ll get aggressive.

My name is Seiji Aoki and I\u2019m the chief producer of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown. I\u2019m very excited to share the inside story behind development of the newest game in the groundbreaking Virtua Fighter series and delve into a few new features you can look forward to when it launches on PlayStation Plus tomorrow, June 1.*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Virtua Fighter holds a special place in Sega lore \u2013 many of us on the dev team can still recall playing the original 3D fighting game when it first launched in arcades nearly 30 years ago. Its strategic depth, balanced combat, and realistic martial arts gameplay have stood out within the genre for decades, and it&#8217;s long past time a new game entered the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206155897_c6946a7c2b_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206155897_c6946a7c2b_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\"><\/a>&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Sega\u2019s 60<sup>th<\/sup> Anniversary, a massive community project celebrating the most iconic games over our entire company history, finally provided us that opportunity. Sega put together a new team of developers from AM2, the original creators of the VF series, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios \u2013 combining extensive console expertise with a deep passion for the franchise to kick off development on a definitive Virtua Fighter game for the new generation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Remade for a new generation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When development began in 2019, we knew there was an entire generation of gamers who had never seen or played Virtua Fighter. To us, 2012\u2019s Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown represented the series pinnacle \u2013 the result of nearly two decades of fine-tuning and development. But many younger fans had never experienced the fluid 60fps martial arts combat, intricately balanced and grounded in reality, that game perfected in its day. We knew from the very beginning that we wanted to re-create that experience on modern consoles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206871121_f77ba090ca_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206871121_f77ba090ca_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206871311_f6dce1535f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206871311_f6dce1535f_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Although Final Showdown was top of its class from a gameplay perspective, the graphics, UI, audio, and especially online play were due for an overhaul. Utilizing RGG\u2019s Dragon Engine Technology, we dramatically upgraded the look and feel of the game, remaking character models and stages entirely from scratch. Visual effects like lighting and shaders received a significant rework, while modern CG expanded the range of effects we could produce. An entirely new opening cinematic added the final layer to the presentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"shortcode shortcode--youtube\">\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video\" data-youtube-id=\"Nu4HyxMPoe0\" data-title=\"\">\n\t<button class=\"youtube-video__load-button\">\n\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--play icon--26 icon--play icon--blue\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title><\/title><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M0 1.75v17l20-8.5z\"\/>\t<\/svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Play  Video<\/span>\n\t<\/button>\n\t\t<img\n\t\tsrc=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/content\/themes\/playstation-2018\/images\/placeholder.svg\"\n\t\tdata-srcset=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/default.jpg 120w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/mqdefault.jpg 320w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/sddefault.jpg 640w, https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/maxresdefault.jpg 1280w\"\n\t\tdata-sizes=\"\"\n\t\tdata-src=\"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Nu4HyxMPoe0\/hqdefault.jpg\"\n\t\tclass=\"youtube-video__image-overlay lazy\"\n\t\talt=\"Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown: Remaking a legend\"\n\t>\n\t\t<div class=\"youtube-video__iframe\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In addition, we wanted to give the same love to the music. Many of our most passionate ideas came from long-time members of the Virtua Fighter sound team \u2013 in the end, we composed new background music for every stage in the game. Players who choose to purchase the new Legendary Pack (DLC) that releases alongside the game tomorrow can also check out the selection of classic and never-before-released background tracks for the full Virtua Fighter audio experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Although the basic gameplay systems from classic Virtua Fighter 5 remain largely untouched \u2013 combat balanced and perfected over years of development \u2013 we didn\u2019t want Ultimate Showdown to feel like a revival of a retro game. Every change we made had to serve our goal of bringing the series forward for a new generation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206156807_7ee6381320_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206156807_7ee6381320_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206156587_1ae3bca1c7_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206156587_1ae3bca1c7_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">New online competitive features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While overhauling VF5\u2019s look and feel was important, re-envisioning online competitive play was vital. Competition \u2013 proving yourself against the best fighters in the world \u2013 has been at the heart of the VF experience since the early arcade days, and we knew we needed to add a ton of new online functionality to bring Ultimate Showdown up to a modern standard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">New Tournaments and round-robin style League Matches, private rooms supporting up to 16 players, and entirely new room UI improving communication between players were just a few of the features we built to support our competitive community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207073028_5e61575dfc_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207073028_5e61575dfc_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207635469_b891f45031_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207635469_b891f45031_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Along with the new modes, match types and UI, we also added new features to enhance the viewing experience. Upgraded hit markers make battles more satisfying and dramatic, while Spectator Mode allows participants to watch matches in real-time from inside their room. Stamps and other messaging tools make for easy communication and add a fun layer of participation. Automatic replay showcasing the recent matches between the top-ranked players in the world is built right into the main game UI.

A vast range of customization items (over 2,000), alternate character costumes, spectator stamps, and new and classic background music options round out the DLC. But our favorite items have to be the fully recreated UI and character models from the original Virtua Fighter! Our designers had a ton of fun rebuilding the old models for all 19 playable characters in such a modern game (two classic-style models for each character \u2013 including each new character from later entries):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209331673_779de2aa9b_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209331673_779de2aa9b_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209890969_fe6ca357c5_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51209890969_fe6ca357c5_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Virtua Fighter V Ultimate Showdown\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To all of the Virtua Fighter fans out there, we are beyond grateful for the passion and loyalty you have shown over the last 27+ years.

We\u2019ve been thrilled to see that players have been enjoying our Bosses so far, and today we wanted to share some notes on Hyperion, who seems to have quickly become a favorite among players!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"ps-block-separator has-max-width-85\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size has-max-width-80 has-margin-bottom-25\"><em>SPOILER WARNING: this piece contains spoilers about the story of Returnal. It\u2019s generally recommended that you read this only after defeating Hyperion, and ideally have seen credits roll.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"ps-block-separator has-max-width-85\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">The inspiration&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">From the very beginning, our goal with the story of Returnal was to haunt the player. On a personal level, many special and haunting moments I\u2019ve experienced in games and film have often been accompanied by powerful music. In many cases I feel that music can be single-handedly responsible for creating the emotional impact and mood of a scene. This ability of music itself to express very complex, raw emotions in a unique way \u2013 to express the intangible \u2013 was the initial seed of inspiration here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">This importance of music was also directly woven into our story, along with our other central elements and themes early on. It started by envisioning our key story beats (beginning, middle and especially our end), and then consciously working backwards from there: identifying which puzzle pieces we would seed throughout the experience to get under the player\u2019s skin, and create the feeling of an overarching, layered mystery for players to solve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One of the crucial puzzle pieces was intended to be a specific piece of music, and throughout the game there are multiple clues that a particular melody is very important to Selene. (Note that I\u2019m being intentionally vague to avoid spoiling too much here!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In parallel, we also knew that we\u2019d want to have some epic bosses in the game. These would need to be memorable highlights that would provide a challenge for players and serve as milestones of progress, but they would also need strongly resonate with players emotionally and be thematically tied to our story as well. In addition to the harsh, dark sci-fi elements of Returnal, we also wanted to explore some more psychological\/surreal themes with our story. Our Bosses would serve as climactic manifestations of those themes. So from very early on we knew that we\u2019d have one Boss that would play with this theme of musicality. This boss was simply codenamed \u201cThe Musician\u201d internally, eventually this became Hyperion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191396191_962de27005_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191396191_962de27005_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Returnal\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The idea for the Musician came first, and then the rest of the Echoing Ruins was built around it to support its presence.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">\u201cThe Musician\u2019s\u201d visual design&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There were some keywords we used to guide our initial concepting for Hypersion: unsettling, musicality, tragic, dramatic, theatricality. Much like our other Bosses, we wanted to make this encounter feel majestic. And what could possibly be more majestic than using an alien Church Organ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I\u2019ve always found the church organ to be one of my favorite instruments (and has been tied to many of my favorite Boss battles in games), and its ability to express grandeur is simply unmatched. It\u2019s also a very beautiful organ in itself, and there was a lot of inspiration drawn from researching large Cathedral church organs. Their massive scale, how they utilize air to practically \u201cbreathe\u201d life into melodies, and how their range can express both extremely delicate sounds but also be very imposing and bombastic when&#8230; It feels alive and powerful &#8211; the perfect fit for Returnal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,1024\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"349610\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/?attachment_id=349610\" class=\"wp-image-349610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C614&amp;zoom=2 2048w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C614&amp;zoom=1.5 1536w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C614&amp;zoom=1 1024w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C614&amp;zoom=0.5 512w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459805_f3dfca3cda_o-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C614&amp;zoom=0.25 256w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1440px) 1200px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"534\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51191397236_092ee2a18d_o.jpg?fit=1024,1024\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"349611\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/?attachment_id=349611\" class=\"wp-image-349611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51191397236_092ee2a18d_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C534&amp;zoom=1.5 1536w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51191397236_092ee2a18d_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C534&amp;zoom=1 1024w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51191397236_092ee2a18d_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C534&amp;zoom=0.5 512w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51191397236_092ee2a18d_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C534&amp;zoom=0.25 256w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1440px) 1200px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459885_3f66b14351_o.jpg?fit=1024,927\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"349612\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459885_3f66b14351_o.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/?attachment_id=349612\" class=\"wp-image-349612\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459885_3f66b14351_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C656&amp;zoom=1 1024w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459885_3f66b14351_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C656&amp;zoom=0.5 512w, https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/tachyon\/2021\/05\/51192459885_3f66b14351_o.jpg?fit=1024%2C656&amp;zoom=0.25 256w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1440px) 1200px, (min-width: 960px) 80vw, 100vw\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Musician himself was envisioned mostly as a tragic figure: a creature that is bound to this otherworldly organ through multiple organic vines and tentacles, fused in a nightmarish, symbiotic relationship. The Musician is clearly obsessed with playing this haunting melody repeatedly \u2013 much like Selene is also haunted by it \u2013 and now that it\u2019s bound to the organ it\u2019s destined to be trapped there playing this melody forever. The hunched over look was inspired by virtuoso pianists, who often appear to be in a meditative trance when playing their tunes. Musician, instrument and music are one and inseparable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">From the early stages we also had the idea of making the back of the boss appear like it could also be its front. We wanted to combine the imagery of the Musician&#8217;s back piece being forcibly bound (almost in a ritualistic manner) to the organ via the organic vines, while also keeping his arms free to play the instrument in the front as well. We also added some subtle facial characteristics on its back, to make the encounter feel slightly more unsettling and also give the player something more recognizable to shoot at (as otherwise its thin silhouette would also get lost amongst the vines and details).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Now let\u2019s look at how we built towards the encounter between Selene and Hyperion in-game, as well as the design of the battle itself. Extra insight comes from Returnal\u2019s Principal Music Producer Joe Thwaites and Senior Game Designer John Hollingworth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Act I &#8211; Failed escape and the song\u2019s setup&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Right before Selene reaches the Echoing Ruins, she experiences our \u201cFailed Escape\u201d ending. In this cinematic, Selene returns to Earth and finds herself haunted by many memories and she tries to resume a normal life. One of these haunting memories seems strongly tied to this particular melody, which just pours out when she sits in front of a piano again. She doesn\u2019t remember exactly why it\u2019s important yet, only that it is. She\u2019ll become obsessed with this melody for the rest of her life. The cinematic ends with her &#8211; now aged &#8211; hands playing it one last time. She takes the mystery of the music with her to her grave.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Act II \u2013 The Cycle continues and the ascension<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Selene dies, and reawakens on Atropos. One of the first things she notices is that same melody playing, as if the planet is using it to torment her further.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Joe Thwaites: <\/strong><em>\u201cThe key objective [of the Echoing Ruins] is to find the source. This melody floats in and out of the ambient, environmental music: if you stop to listen, you can hear the distant sounds of the alien organ float in the wind. We used 3D audio capabilities* to position the melody in the environment. As you move through the level, the melody will play from the direction of the Echoing Vault, helping to lead the player to the source of the music. Pass through the Echoing Vault and you entire the spire\u2026 Hyperion\u2019s resting ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207713720_d77c0657b4_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207713720_d77c0657b4_o.jpg\" alt=\"Returnal\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>As you explore the Echoing Ruins, you encounter various hollow plants that seem to be playing the same melody.

As you climb the spire, the clearer that music becomes. We wanted to create the feeling of moving towards the objective. We used the distance from the top of the spire as a parameter to add new layers and feed intensity into the music. We also add layers of saturation as you approach the top, giving the sense that the alien organ is so loud that it\u2019s distorting.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When you work your way to the top, you\u2019re confronted with a surreal sight: this huge creature obsessively &#8211; yet serenely &#8211; playing an organic church-like organ.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Joe Thwaites<\/strong>: <em>\u201cOnce the player steps into the arena the mood changes and the pace picks up.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Boss 2 Clip 1\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/necessarybeloveddachshund#?secret=nw78tNabYq' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Act III &#8211; The Bullet Ballet&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For our boss battle, we wanted The Musician to utilize the organ. It would demonstrate its mastery of the organ (and attached vines\/tentacles) to attack Selene with a cacophony of bullets and a cosmic symphony of explosions.

With each passing phase the difficulty and intensity increases, Hyperion plays the Organ near the end of each phase to unleash new chords of destruction at the player.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Joe Thwaites<\/strong>: \u201c<em>Hyperion\u2019s obsession with the tune and the repetitive nature of this arpeggio creates a relentless wall of sound that accompanies the barrage of projectiles that emanate from the organ. The organ sound itself is made-up of a combination of real and synthetic organs put through some processing to make the sound aggressive and alien. This sits really nicely with Bobby Krilic\u2019s percussive and synth-driven score which kicks in when the combat starts.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>John Hollington: \u201c<\/strong><em>Similar to a single musical note, each attack from the barrel of the organ doesn&#8217;t provide much on it&#8217;s own, but when they all come together in sequence it provides a challenging bullet hell symphony which forces the player to keep moving until it is silenced.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Boss 1 Clip 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/givingickyfinwhale#?secret=8PaoU5DKzK' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>\u201cEvery pattern was carefully balanced and tweaked from countless amounts of testing. As a team we were always pushing for bigger attacks, more bullets and impressive chaotic patterns, particularly for the Organ. However, we were very cautious of difficulty and readability. The visual language of the projectiles play an enormous role in that. By contrasting them clearly against each other it allows the player to quickly and easily identify the patterns and react to the attacks.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>\u201cThe colour of projectiles used represent the style of attack. Green is commonly used for more random, non-direct clusters (Low reaction response from the player). Orange is reserved for slower moving non-targeting shapes that consume space (Medium player reaction) and blue projectiles are for Hyperion&#8217;s main attacks, they are often direct and require the player to quickly respond to the threat (High reaction). These consistent colour-coordinated layers work together and overlap to create a truly chaotic scene, but one which allows the player to work around, read the threats clearly and slip through the designed gaps.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>The attacks need to present themselves so even if the player is completely overwhelmed at first, after time, practice and experience the boss could be defeated without the player taking a single hit of damage.

Yet even without this constraint, the Musician still returns to the solace of the organ for one final time as he senses his end drawing near in the final phase. This draws further symmetry with Selene&#8217;s story in the Failed Escape, where Selene is also seen repeatedly playing this melody just moments before her death as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Act IV &#8211; The silence<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Just like many encounters in Returnal, the Musician also plays an important role in Selene\u2019s story. Defeating Hyperion marks a bittersweet moment in Selene\u2019s journey: although she silences the song, the haunting melody still lingers in her mind as she keeps exploring its significance. Along with the players sharing her journey, they will discover the significance of this song (and much more) later in the game together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Thanks so much for reading about the origins of Hyperion, and thanks to players who have stepped in the haunting world of Atropos.

I\u2019m really excited to give everyone a look at Griftlands which launches June 4 on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 backwards compatibility. Griftlands is a narrative RPG featuring multiple branching stories to experience based on your actions and choices. It&#8217;s also a deck-building card game with deep interlocking systems driving both combat and negotiation through card mechanics. We think players are going to have a lot of fun fighting, lying, cheating, bribing, and smooth-talking their way to victory. Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There are three main characters in Griftlands, each with their own problem to solve. Sal the bounty hunter wants revenge. Rook the spy is working on a mysterious contract. Smith is trying to collect his inheritance, and have a good time doing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Griftlands montage\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/shockedhairyantarcticfurseal#?secret=flMGDFy1gi' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Those high-level goals are the same every time you play, but the day-to-day obstacles that you overcome in their pursuit vary wildly. Different subplots and events get drawn from a pool each time. The cast of characters shifts as different NPCs get cast in different roles and react to your choices. Your friend in one playthrough, with their unique mechanical strengths and weaknesses, may be your enemy in the next.

Playing cards make them stronger each time they\u2019re played and picking one deck over another will give you the option of adding a new card to it at the end of successful encounters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Griftlands combat no mouse\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/criminalsentimentalbullfrog#?secret=siLpPxMtTi' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Succeeding comes down to having the right cards and playing them correctly in each situation. But you can&#8217;t always do exactly what you want &#8211; context matters. Your decks get stronger with use, so it&#8217;s important to balance your use of each, lest one of your skills falls behind and you get caught off guard by a powerful opponent. NPCs will also notice everything that you do and treat you accordingly. Saving someone from wild animals will earn their respect but killing someone&#8217;s best friend for example will have them seeking revenge and actively working against you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Griftlands heads or snails\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/immensegenerousantipodesgreenparakeet#?secret=TJN5g2oncz' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Here&#8217;s a concrete example, featuring Rook:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191844931_5bee56064d_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191844931_5bee56064d_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rook&#8217;s employer gives him a choice of jobs at the start of day two. He chooses to collect a debt from Ionis. On the way to find her, Rook encounters a stranger being attacked by wild animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192060158_6715294d62_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192060158_6715294d62_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It&#8217;s early on the second day of Rook&#8217;s story, so he has a relatively strong combat deck. He chooses to fight the beasts. He wins at the cost of a little health and also gets to pick a new combat card to add to his deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191845211_10607e71a3_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191845211_10607e71a3_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">After the fight, we discover the stranger\u2019s name is Wade, and she offers to give Rook a reward. Rook refuses the reward, instead earning Wade&#8217;s gratitude. This gives him a passive bonus based on Wade&#8217;s character class. Also, Wade promises to help him in the future if she is able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192615799_499edd25f8_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192615799_499edd25f8_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rook continues to the job. He intimidates Ionis and collects the debt. This angers Ionis, who vows revenge. This gives Rook an ongoing, passive penalty, which makes completing his second job that day more difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192910780_cf9b4d8ff0_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192910780_cf9b4d8ff0_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">At the end of the day, Rook returns to the inn where he&#8217;s staying. By happenstance, both Ionis and Wade are there. This is Rook&#8217;s opportunity to finally do something about that pesky penalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192059958_0a324f2343_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192059958_0a324f2343_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rook tries to provoke Ionis with a negotiation.

Enraged at being outtalked, a now hot-headed Ionis challenges him to a duel and attacks. Rook&#8217;s upgraded combat deck makes short work of his foe, and both Ionis and her penalty die on the dirt-encrusted floor of the inn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191135372_2decb36ecb_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51191135372_2decb36ecb_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Griftlands\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Rook recovers some lost resolve by sharing some refreshments with his best friend Wade before continuing to the day&#8217;s boss fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Every run through Griftlands weaves these narratives seamlessly through the main plot. You will have different allies and enemies each time, and the relative strengths of your two decks will present you with new and interesting challenges.

The noble knight Arthur sets out on a new adventure to rescue the princess from the Demon Realm in Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection, coming to PlayStation 4 (and backwards compatible with PlayStation 5) on June 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Some 35 years ago, the first Ghosts \u2018n Goblins made its grand debut in arcades. Few players knew what would await them as they dropped that first quarter into the machine, and fewer still could have guessed that beating the game would set them up for a ghoulish surprise; the game wasn\u2019t over until you completed it a second time after a brutal second loop of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The hard-as-nails legacy of Ghosts \u2018n Goblins has earned the franchise a reputation for its difficulty over the years but for this entry, we\u2019ve kept the challenge while making the game far more accessible. Not only are there multiple difficulty modes that cater to players of all skill levels, we\u2019ve also included a series first: two-player local co-op.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"GUILLOTINE Short Clip\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/impartialelementaryemeraldtreeskink#?secret=zcQsn43nrF' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">To shine a light on the decision to give this traditionally single-player experience a two-player twist, we spoke with the game\u2019s Chief Producer, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi (a.k.a. \u201cH\u201d). Best known for his work on the Resident Evil franchise, H was kind enough to speak with us about how this mode came to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThe local co-op mode was an idea that existed from the earliest stages of the development phase, and was brought up by Director Tokuro Fujiwara,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. Long-time Capcom fans may recognize that name \u2013 Mr. Fujiwara was also the director of the original Ghosts \u2018n Goblins, and returned to direct Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection, as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThe first time the format and goals of this mode were presented by Director Fujiwara, I felt that it was spectacular and I wanted to make it happen, \u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When you consider how long the franchise has been a strictly single-player affair, it raises the question: What made this the right time to add co-op?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThis IP has been loved by many players for over 35 years, and those who played the earlier titles may now have kids of their own,\u201d explains Mr. Hirabayashi. Mr. Hirabayashi recalls that the entire dev team was excited by the idea of co-op mode, hoping this addition would allow the game to transcend generations and offer a great way for long-time fans to share this arcade-style experience with their kids or even family and friends who may be new to platformers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cOf course, it was a challenge for us to prepare this mode, as we knew there were going to be certain expectations since this is the first title within the series that supports this kind of gameplay,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cOvercoming the difficulty the game provides while having fun playing and communicating with your friend or loved one is a brand new concept, and we weren\u2019t sure how players were going to react to this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205732169_0dc1853719_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205732169_0dc1853719_h.jpg\" alt=\"Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Despite these concerns, Mr. Fujiwara seemed confident in its inclusion and the joy it would bring to players both young and old.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cWhen Director Fujiwara first explained the concept of this co-op mode to me, I remember imagining how much fun it would be to enjoy this game with my child,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cI was very excited about it!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Of course, Ghosts \u2018n Goblins is known for its difficulty more than most other games of its time (and even games today), and the team considered that factor, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cFrom the beginning, the concept of the co-op mode was to provide a brand new experience unique from the single-player mode so there wasn\u2019t a strong need for it to be balanced in comparison to the difficulty of the standard experience,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cThe aim of this mode is to get two players to have fun cooperating together to overcome a challenge, and the balancing of the difficulty was not a big priority.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In other words, the goal for this mode was not to create an experience that would be challenging for two players, but rather to make the game fun for two people to enjoy it together. It brings a different feel to the game while not taking away from the solo challenge that it offers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cWith this in mind, we designed the support characters to be flexible in terms of their functionality, and helpful when it comes to assisting Arthur,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cWe hope that when players experience this mode, they can loosen up and have a fun time talking and working together.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Speaking of those support characters, there\u2019s three in total: Barry, Kerry, and Archie. As their names might suggest, these spirited assistants each serve a different purpose when it comes to aiding Arthur. However, they aren\u2019t just helpers \u2013 there\u2019s a bit of story there, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cThe Three Wise Guys are Arthur\u2019s ancestors, and, considering their role of being assistants who helps him, we thought this was the most appropriate way to include them,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Considering they\u2019re his ancestors, you might want to take a closer look at their mannerisms. \u201cEach Wise Guy has their own unique design, but if you look at them carefully, don\u2019t you think they look a bit like Arthur?,\u201d asks Mr. Hirabayashi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206029780_16bc753897_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51206029780_16bc753897_h.jpg\" alt=\"Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Aside from their designs, special attention was also paid to how each one plays. Each of Arthur\u2019s ancestors boasts their own unique skills, adding a new layer to co-op gameplay.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cAn important thing to note is that the functionality of the Three Wise Guys are different from what Arthur is capable of doing,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cOur intention was to provide a brand new experience that the single player mode can\u2019t deliver on, and give the players a way to expand on the fun ideas that are only available in co-op mode.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Funnily enough, Mr. Fujiwara seems to still have a bit of a mischievous approach when it comes to game design \u2013&nbsp; even for elements of the game that <em>should <\/em>be friendly in the hands of two players playing side-by-side.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve been talking about this as a co-op mode, but the Director has always been expecting there to be certain players who will think of fun ways to play this mode that aren\u2019t necessarily \u2018cooperative\u2019,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cFor example, Kerry is a character who literally carries Arthur around, but that doesn\u2019t always mean he\u2019s going to place Arthur on solid ground. A co-op partner with a mischievous spirit may ultimately become a hindrance, making the game feel more like a single-player mode with another troublesome enemy that gets in your way!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205732154_2d84e0042b_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205732154_2d84e0042b_h.jpg\" alt=\"Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">True to Ghosts \u2018n Goblins, even having someone else join you in co-op can still be part of the challenge. Turns out there are some things worse than a Red Arremer, and they might be sitting right next to you on the couch. Perhaps most importantly, Mr. Hirabayashi envisions people finding their own ways to enjoy co-op in unexpected ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cWe designed the support characters this way on purpose,\u201d says Mr. Hirabayashi. \u201cA fun way we thought players could enjoy the game is for players controlling Arthur to try to complete a stage under a certain amount of time, and for the \u2018support\u2019 character to keep him from accomplishing his goal.\u201d For seasoned veterans playing with newly christened knights, coming up with unique ways to use the co-op mode is a great way to find new and fun ways to enjoy the game together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I\u2019d like to provide a huge thank you to Mr. Hirabayashi for taking the time to answer our questions about the co-op mod.! And co-op isn\u2019t the only way to enjoy the game. With multiple difficulty modes, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the game at a pace that\u2019s right for you and explore everything that Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection has to offer. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be a GnG game if the game ended after the first playthrough, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Be sure to grab your throwing lance and a co-op buddy to play with \u2013 or against \u2013 and get ready to <em>challenge again <\/em>when Ghosts \u2018n Goblins Resurrection launches on PS4 June 1!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get ready to challenge again!

If you haven&#8217;t already run off to download it (and I really can&#8217;t blame you for that), let&#8217;s take a look behind the curtain. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"SWP VR Gif Mandalorian Multiball\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/opennaughtyabyssiniangroundhornbill#?secret=IIkY7nd3WW' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>1. Picking the theme<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">First, we have to figure out our topic &#8212; something we work very closely with Lucasfilm Games to decide. Sometimes the topic ends up being a show like Star Wars Rebels, sometimes it&#8217;s a general theme like Jedi versus Sith in Masters of the Force; in this table&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s a wisecracking Correllian smuggler. Han Solo was a natural fit to get his own board, as his life is filled with funny shenanigans, exciting moments, plus he flies the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"SWP VR Han Solo Gif Falcon\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/imperturbablebriskdalmatian#?secret=YCWeXaeIpT' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>2. Pinball table layout<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once we agree on the topic, that\u2019s where things get technical. As pinball legend Roger Sharpe, famous for lifting the ban on pinball in New York City in 1976, told Vox, \u201cEach game is different &#8212; each game has different geometry, each game has different rules.\u201d This means we need a strong base of lanes, rails, sinkholes, and everything else you might recognize on any machine. This gives you the main gameplay layer, where a satisfying ramp shot can make or break a table, whatever theme you put over it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>3. Translating iconic moments to missions<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once we\u2019ve nailed the concepts, that\u2019s when we turn on the pizzazz! All the different rules, multiballs, lamps and animated characters come into play. This is where we have to nail the best moments and translate them to pinball form. For Han Solo, our design team got together and created an extensive list from the classic-era happenings involving our favorite nerf herder &#8212; and his loyal copilot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203839892_8d8ed9002e_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203839892_8d8ed9002e_h.jpg\" alt=\"GAMETITLE\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The different \u201cmodes\u201d (which are missions on a pinball table, each needing you to shoot a different part of the table, or a combination) will take you back to epic moments like freeing Princess Leia from the Death Star in A New Hope, navigating the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back, and escaping from Jabba in Return of the Jedi<em>.<\/em> If you complete all of Han\u2019s adventures, it all culminates in what we call the \u2018Wizard mode\u2019 (anyone like The Who?) named General Solo. This is an epic mode where four balls are let into play and a huge jackpot activates &#8211; a hard to achieve but infinitely rewarding mission to reward you for your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205622795_994dcac620_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51205622795_994dcac620_h.jpg\" alt=\"GAMETITLE\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I urge you to put yourself in Total Immersion mode &#8212; something only VR can pull off &#8212; where you will be roughly the size of the ball and look closely at all the pieces of Han\u2019s life. Like the Carbonite chamber (you can lock three balls in there and start a multiball!) or the Space Slug to the right of the table which &#8211; just like in the film &#8211; has a great big maw to swallow up your pinballs and reward you later.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You can put what we learned here to good use &#8212; and sooner than you think. The Han Solo pinball table is available for Star Wars Pinball VR <em>right now.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">There\u2019s plenty of jackpots to be had and high scores to break, but just remember: Don\u2019t get cocky, kid!&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, we at Zen Studios could not be happier than to announce free DLC for Star Wars Pinball VR right here on PlayStation Blog.

You may also spend some of your splendid summertime in Teyvat in an uncharted sea area for a limited time during Version 1.6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208534440_3f71a2f7a3_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208534440_3f71a2f7a3_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Midsummer Island Adventure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If you&#8217;re fond of sailing, exploring, and fighting, we may have something for you in Version 1.6&#8217;s main seasonal event: Midsummer Island Adventure. The story begins when Klee receives a mysterious letter from a Dodo-King threatening to take Dodoco away from her. To help Klee and Dodoco, the Traveler will sail on a boat called a Waverider and explore a secluded archipelago scattered over a remote sea area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Midsummer Island Adventure main event will be divided into four stages, each featuring unique gameplay. In the first stage, players need to sail on the Waverider and destroy enemy floating towers and encampments, either through firing your boat&#8217;s cannon or in close combat. In the next stage, players will be challenged in a race that combines both sailing and flying. The third stage will put your combat skills to test with the new opponent, Maguu Kenki. And finally, players will be asked to clear out nearby monster encampments with the aid of three kinds of Harpastum Bombs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208233144_db2060868e_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208233144_db2060868e_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We also want to introduce a bit more about the new monster mentioned earlier, Maguu Kenki. With its unique Inazuma-style aesthetic, Maguu Kenki also has its own attack style. When Maguu Kenki&#8217;s health falls below a certain amount, it will summon phantoms and can deal both Anemo and Cryo damage against players. In addition, any ranged attack will be blocked if Maguu Kenki is not engaged in close-range battle, forcing players to confront it face-to-face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Bountiful rewards also await you in the Event Shop. By completing the main event challenges mentioned earlier, you can obtain two event currencies, Shiny Flotsam and Mini Harpastum, which can be used to exchange for various resources and items, as well as the new four-star catalyst Dodoco Tales up to maximum refinement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207670528_0793df3013_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207670528_0793df3013_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Dress up for the summer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">No summer vacation is complete without cool summer clothes. Therefore, we&#8217;ve designed summer-themed outfits for Jean and Barbara, providing you the first-ever chance to dress them up with alternate outfits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Jean&#8217;s outfit Sea Breeze Dandelion will be available for purchase in the in-game Shop at a limited-time discount. Barbara&#8217;s outfit Summertime Sparkle will be free to claim by participating in the Echoing Tales event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207467406_edea559761_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207467406_edea559761_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">During the Echoing Tales event, items called Echoing Conches can be found all over the archipelago. By collecting the Echoing Conches, not only can you listen to some interesting stories and tales, but you can also get Barbara&#8217;s new outfit if you accumulate enough Conches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We&#8217;ve also prepared other events full of fun games and challenges on the archipelago. So be sure to check out this limited-time new area during Version 1.6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208233129_587308c56f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51208233129_587308c56f_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>One step closer to Inazuma<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Kaedehara Kazuha, the first playable character from Inazuma, will officially join the game during Version 1.6. Wielding an Anemo Vision and a sword, Kazuha not only boasts a versatile combat style, but also provides buffs to his teammates under certain circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Kazuha&#8217;s Elemental Skill Chihayaburu will release a rushing wind current that pulls objects and opponents towards his current position before launching nearby opponents, dealing Anemo damage and lifting Kazuha into the air. When Kazuha is in mid-air from the effects of Chihayaburu, he can unleash a special Plunging Attack, &#8220;Midare Ranzan,&#8221; dealing Anemo damage and creating a miniature wind tunnel that sucks in surrounding objects and opponents. His Elemental Burst Kazuha Slash will attack the enemies with Anemo AoE damage in a single strike, and leave behind a storm field that deals Anemo AoE damage at set intervals to all opponents within. To make Kazuha even more powerful, both his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can deal additional elemental damage if they come into contact with Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, or Electro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Kazuha also provides additional buffs to the team, making him a great choice for your party and team. Upon triggering a Swirl reaction, Kazuha can grant his teammates an elemental damage bonus for their corresponding element. One of his other Passive Talents can decrease sprinting stamina consumption for your own party members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In the latest Archon Quest, Kazuha will also provide clues about the way to the closed-off Inazuma. For some reason, this wandering samurai is wanted by the Inazuma Shogunate and now traveling with Beidou&#8217;s Crux Fleet. The Crux Clash, a grand martial arts tournament, will be held there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207467456_eb35512f22_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207467456_eb35512f22_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Genshin Impact\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Other improvements and more<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As always, in the end we&#8217;d like to share some adjustments our team has decided on to improve the current gameplay based on serious considerations and player feedback! Some of you might have already noticed a patch released shortly after Version 1.5 went live. The patch aims to improve performance from several perspectives, including a steady rise in frame rate on PS5 and PS4.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With Version 1.6, if you&#8217;re fond of the Serenitea Pot we introduced earlier, you will also be able to invite characters you own to reside in your realm. Characters in your realm will gradually accumulate Character Companionship Experience over time, and this rate of increase will grow faster with a higher Adeptal Energy Rank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">And that&#8217;s all we&#8217;d like to share ahead of the Version 1.6 release on June 9!

The Pullcaster speeds up climbing, getting her quickly out of trouble; the Shieldwing allows her to safely descend from great heights (or surprise enemies from above); and with the Diving Mask, a whole new underwater world is open for exploration. Not to mention big upgrades to her Focus, which now shows areas that allow free-climbing and gives her the ability to override more machines for mounts or combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207430423_d77ab8ab95_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51207430423_d77ab8ab95_h.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon Forbidden West\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Speaking of combat, <em>Horizon Forbidden West<\/em> puts the emphasis on tactics and choice by giving the player a huge variety of weapons. Aloy\u2019s trusty Spear is good for close combat and enables a new set of combos. Bows with specialized ammo types strip armor off machines to expose their weak spots. Adhesive grenades can be fired from slingshots, temporarily stalling foes.

Humanity lost there, but now a glimmer of hope emerges in The City, one of the last bastions of mankind in Dying Light 2 Stay Human\u2014for the survival of the entire human race, but also for you, a wandering pilgrim, serving as a connection between the scattered settlements. Driven by a promise of unveiling the secrets of your past and finding the one you\u2019ve lost, you pause your travels and begin forging your own legend there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203060146_d1ec65a1c9_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203060146_d1ec65a1c9_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dying Light 2 \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Dying Light 2 Stay Human offers a broad, tiered open world full of unique architecture. As civilization has fallen back to the Dark Ages, The City interlaces modern urban structures with medieval buildings and agricultural land. Your main way of traveling is your parkour abilities, but you\u2019ve also got a grappling hook and a paraglider to navigate smoothly through its many levels. Most often, there\u2019s more than one way to reach your destination, so try to be creative and play with your skills to discover new possibilities and test your limits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203833494_3f425c39ca_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51203833494_3f425c39ca_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dying Light 2 \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">During your adventure, you\u2019ll learn that The City\u2019s a living and breathing world.

It\u2019s often up to you who\u2019s going to have the upper hand in the ongoing conflict, but remember that the consequences of your choices are yours to face, too. The City is a complex organism that will react to your decisions. Depending on whom you support, the setting around you will change, offering you new opportunities, but also posing many new challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51204125310_239a8f01c5_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51204125310_239a8f01c5_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Dying Light 2 \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When it comes to combat, your choices are equally crucial.

Though it\u2019s their time now, your extraordinary abilities allow you to still make the most of it. While monsters are busy hunting their prey, you can enter and search their hideouts, where you\u2019ll often find powerful, unique items.

We thought the best way to achieve this was to give our characters agile and skillful movement, which empowers subterfuge and stealth assault instead of a lot of strength. It also strengthens the exciting feeling of overcoming overwhelming odds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Aragami 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/bothheartycat#?secret=IF4zX0e0LQ' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">We based the combat on fast character movement, explosive dodges, and lightning-fast combo attacks. At the same time, we discouraged blocking, since we want to keep action fast-paced and convey that our character uses his agility and reflexes over strength. Instead, we favored parries, since they are more dynamic and technical in their application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But how does this work with a three-player co-op system?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Let\u2019s start by looking back at the previous game we released &#8211; Aragami. The two-player co-op feature worked very well in Aragami: players loved beating the campaign alongside a friend and planning different strategies to complete the missions. We were overwhelmed by the impressive amount of players sharing their walkthroughs and also seeing them establishing their own identity combining different character skins and dyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Given the positive reception, it was very clear that the co-op would be one of the main pillars for the development of Aragami 2 from the very beginning, but deciding for a three player co-op instead of two or four, was more an iteration process than a pre-reasoned decision. Narratively, we had to create a sensation of a clan and not to center on a lonely ninja, and the option of a two-player co-op didn\u2019t reinforce this idea. We first explored with a four-player co-op, which is more classic in video games, but that gave a lot of trouble when balancing and, in our opinion, the stealth component was easily lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Aragami 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/soggyrightbeardeddragon#?secret=kT7GRS95GH' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Scout ahead and plan the attack&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">When we tried with the three-player option, we immediately felt that we had found that sweet spot between feeling like being part of a clan or squad while maintaining the feeling of stealthiness and being outnumbered by the enemy. We had so much fun doing three-player speedruns competitions in the studio to see who arrived first to the end of a level!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The chance to play as a three-ninja squad opens up a wide arrangement of possibilities and versatility. You can have one player acting as a scout from an elevated spot marking nearby enemies, another taking down them from the ground, and the other stealing an item you need to complete the mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Aragami 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/saltyabandonedabyssiniangroundhornbill#?secret=npOmtym6ZE' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Then divide, conquer, and execute from the shadows<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But there are many challenges you face when introducing three-player co-op. We wanted to give each player their own identity, including visual distinctions like different skins, dyes, and equipment. Unique gameplay across co-op was also important. It meant we had to design gameplay that adapts to every user, whether they are more combat-focused, stealthy, or more acrobatic. We had to give players the chance to play the way they want. Hence, we have a robust ability tree allowing players to specialize in their own craft. This is a pretty complex thing to achieve \u2014 making sure that this variety and possibilities exist, and that it\u2019s fun, challenging, and well balanced. And this also applies to combat, as you don\u2019t want the game to feel too easy when playing in co-op, or to eliminate the feeling of the game being a stealth title, which is our core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Aragami 2\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/accurateimpracticalinchworm#?secret=qNcC0QcDh7' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">As a solo player, you can only unlock half of the ability tree when arriving to the maximum level, encouraging you to find partners that complement your playstyle with other roles.

We wanted to make a sci-fi adventure game overflowing with cool African inspirations and portrayals. So naturally the characters took a front row seat in this, be it in their looks, names, the slang they use, and working with African voice actors we brought on to bring them to life. So here are just five characters to look out for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51201819704_ab003ee90c_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51201819704_ab003ee90c_h.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Desolation\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Oothee &#8211; Hanasi Shield Maiden&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>&#8220;If a people&#8217;s history is taken from them, they will do whatever it takes to reclaim it.&#8221; &#8211; Oothee<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Hanasi is a once-proud warrior tribe who ruled with an iron fist.

Now they waste away in the harsh sunlight begging for scrap from passers-by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Oothee or Momma as the Hanasi call her, is the matriarch of this tribe. She appears as a young woman but is truly ancient. Some speculate that her mind simply moves from one Hanasi Maiden to the next. Oothee and her brothers set out to unite the Hanasi and using a medicinal herb they have found a way to commune with their ancestors on the astral plane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51200326677_d34e92e21f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51200326677_d34e92e21f_h.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Desolation\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>The Grand Maw &#8211; Ruler Of The Fley<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>&#8220;The host must be a child.

At its weird little heart, Beautiful Desolation is a story-driven sci-fi adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic, distant future South Africa, reshaped by alien technology. We want players to know this is not some deep RPG with crazy character customization, item stats, loot hunting or constant combat. Rather, the core of the gameplay is about exploring this twisted, sci-fi African setting, meeting bizarre characters, making story defining dialogue choices, and solving a few puzzles.

Hills, hazards, and other units all affect the outcome of combat. If you step up to attack a squad while standing next to a hazard, you might find yourself knocked into it on the next turn. You can mitigate this by positioning troops to prevent enemies from occupying the spaces that would allow that position; it can be worth giving up a potential attack if it means protecting your hero from death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.78% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.33% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/fluidmedicalbushbaby#?secret=UNM03DVRPf' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Experiment with different troop synergies, wargear, and skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Ranged units like Castigators and Chainghasts can be modified to penetrate armour, increase damage, or set fire to their targets. Heavily modified units do cost more to field, so sometimes it can be worth keeping a slot empty in order to field them earlier. Battle after battle, you will learn about the enemy&#8217;s weaknesses and equip your units for the dangers that await you. Sometimes a simple skill swap is enough to make the difference between victory and defeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Your economy matters<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Power lets you field units and Divine Acts, but unspent power converts to Aethyr which lets you use magical abilities with your fielded troops. Do you field early troops to let you capture wellsprings that raise your power and aether resources, or do you commit your hero to an assault taking advantage of their abilities. These are all choices that will affect the outcome of each fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>The most powerful attacks are as spectacular to field as they are in strength<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Lord Celestant can summon a powerful Stardrake to the field, and strafe a row of enemies, and Endless Spells like the Purple Sun are both gorgeous to look at and explosive to field. The Stormcast Eternals, Nighthaunt, and Maggotkin armies are fantastic to play in all meanings of the word. But your most powerful abilities, such as transforming your Maggotkin of Nurgle hero into a giant and devastating Great Unclean One takes several turns, costs a significant amount of power, and leaves the unit vulnerable during the incantation. It&#8217;s up to you to choose the best time to invoke these powerful techniques by protecting your ally or incapacitating the opponent during this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.78% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.33% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/falseimaginativebrant#?secret=G1tzfhBVGp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Persistence pays off<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Each run of the campaign will be different: there are hundreds of items to earn in both the campaign, as well as in online multiplayer. Your army, items, and skills all benefit from investing time in finding more options to field. Whether you are fighting through the most difficult encounters of the campaign or squaring off against skilled opponents online, there is more to earn across the entirety of Storm Ground. On top of that, the campaign is filled with dozens of journals to discover &#8211; these character-narrated accounts offer a great introduction to the universe of Age of Sigmar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.78% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.33% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/blinddearestblacknorwegianelkhound#?secret=1b4UldrbZS' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Take full advantage of Piercing Armor<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Some units have armor that protects their health from damage. Without special abilities or powerful attacks, they will be a challenge during battles. Consider equipping your troops with abilities that can break or pass through these protections. Not all of your units are able to pierce through the enemy armor as easily as your Heroes. Make sure they can deal with it to increase your supporting unit\u2019s damage output. However, armor never completely protects a unit &#8211; there\u2019s always a chance that an attack will find a weak spot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Cash in on caches<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Loot and Lore caches can be found on most battlefields, granting additional items and bonuses. They are sometimes hard to reach, but the reward may be worth the risk. It&#8217;s up to you to decide which unit you want to send to get them. Be careful though &#8211; since your opponent can also claim the loot, and chests disappear at the end of the battle if no one has claimed it. Each cache glows according to the rarity of the items inside and grants you powerful weapons, armors, abilities and lore elements to discover the secrets of the Mortal Realms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Not all actions are immediate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While most attacks deal damage right away, certain skills are delayed. Anticipating your enemies\u2019 next moves will allow you to deal higher damage later. Some units, such as the Stormcast Castigators, have powerful delayed field attacks. It is often wiser to ambush your opponents by luring them (sometimes even against their will with certain abilities) into your trap. Delayed abilities are a great way to control the pace of a fight if you want to get the most out of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Prepare to battle in Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground tomorrow on PlayStation 4.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the Mortal Realms!

Last year, we held the first-ever DreamsCom, a community convention dedicated to showing off a ton of the brilliant creators and creations in the Dreamiverse.

We\u2019re thrilled to be doing this again, and we\u2019re determined to make this year\u2019s show even better than the last.

This year, we\u2019ll be bringing you multiple days of official DreamsCom coverage live on stream, courtesy of our new editorial brand The Impsider. We\u2019ll be kicking off proceedings with a livestream, in which we\u2019ll give you an advance look at the week of DreamsCom broadcasts ahead, on Tuesday July 27 at 5PM BST \/ 9am PST via our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/media_molecule\">Twitch<\/a> channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51202536877_7c56e748a6_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51202536877_7c56e748a6_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Impsider Logo\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The very next day, on Wednesday July 28, we\u2019ll open up the DreamsCom \u201821 show floor, which is &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; entirely #MadeInDreams! Like last year, you\u2019ll be able to wander about the halls and visit creators\u2019 booths to check out all the amazing stuff you\u2019ve seen on stream for yourself. The expo will run until Monday 2nd August to give you plenty of time to look around, admire everybody\u2019s handiwork, and snap a bunch of photos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">From Wednesday July 28 until Friday July 30, you can tune in to our Twitch channel to catch us playing and chatting about some of the DreamsCom creations we\u2019re most excited about, as part of The Impsider\u2019s extended DreamsCom coverage. We\u2019ll also be running developer sessions in which we interview dreamers about their work, their creative inspirations, and possibly even their favorite type of biscuit if we start running out of grown-up questions. Hopefully this should give DreamsCom visitors a few ideas for what they might like to check out first at the expo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">After all, we\u2019re hoping that &#8211; like last year &#8211; it\u2019s going to be packed to the rafters with bright, brilliant booths\u2026 made by YOU! This is your open invitation to exhibit at DreamsCom 2021 by customising a booth to represent your in-development projects or in-Dreams studios on the show floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51204028454_d3b1a5585a_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51204028454_d3b1a5585a_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Booth Template 2\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51202536852_ddca327808_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51202536852_ddca327808_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Example Booth - Gaming\" width=\"47%\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Fancy becoming an exhibitor?

To mark the upcoming July 27 release of Samurai Warriors 5 on PlayStation 4, I sat down with Samurai Warriors producer and Koei Tecmo president, Hisashi Koinuma, to discuss the evolution of the iconic action series.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">What\u2019s it like working on a video game franchise for 18 years? \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, but I never thought I\u2019d be working on this series for so long,\u201d says Koinuma. \u201cWe made the first Samurai Warriors title in response to how popular Dynasty Warriors 2 was, and we wanted to make a Japanese counterpart set in the Sengoku period, in the same way that we have the Romance Of The Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga&#8217;s Ambition series.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cFortunately the first Samurai Warriors game was very well received and continues to be enjoyed by the fans to this day. It&#8217;s thanks to their support that we were able to continue the series for this long.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But what does Koinuma-san have up his sleeves for the latest, and what he calls \u201cre-imagined\u201d Samurai Warriors 5? We caught up with the boss behind the in-game bosses to find out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: After almost two decades of working on Samurai Warriors, what\u2019s your favorite thing about working on the franchise?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A: <\/strong>My favorite thing is choosing which Samurai Warriors to include from the Sengoku period when we are working on creating the theme of the story, along with seeing the reactions from all of our fans when they see them in the game. In Japan, it is really fascinating to see the response not only from fans, but from regions that have a connection to those Samurai Warriors, especially museums and public transportation companies such as trains and taxis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: Why did you decide to drastically overhaul the visuals for the new game?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A: <\/strong>The theme for Samurai Warriors 5 is to rewrite the first title, so we decided to re-imagine everything in the series. The story, characters, action system, and also the art and visual style were all aspects we wanted to re-imagine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188338246_00ba4a663f_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188338246_00ba4a663f_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Samurai Warriors 5\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: How would you best describe the re-imagined look of SW5?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A:<\/strong> We continuously discussed what would work best as a Japanese aesthetic for the game, and after taking everything into consideration, we decided on a visual style that looked like an illustration that incorporated aspects of Japanese ink paintings. We were going for a dynamic yet detailed look for this new entry in the series, and I feel we have achieved an art style that is recognizable as being completely different from the rest of the series just with once glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: What influenced the new art style for SW5?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A<\/strong>: As I noted in regards to describing the new look, we had a lot of inspiration from Japanese ink paintings, one of the major styles of ink wash paintings, along with Japanese pop art which has received a lot of praise from around the world. We also took inspiration from a number of different games as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: Looking back throughout the history of the game, what are some of the biggest visual changes that have been made throughout the years leading up to SW5?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A:<\/strong> The first Samurai Warriors game was released on PS2, so having access to shading technology, which was becoming popularized at that time, was a big change for the visual style of the game. As a result, the photo-realistic style became more prevalent, along with more detailed cel shading technology, along with 2D art styles which have become popularized in smartphone apps. These were all really big changes in technology for us. Thanks to all of these tools and technological advances, we were able to take these styles into account when creating Samurai Warriors 5, and we decided to pursue a visual style that could only be done in this title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51201266669_766ac87a35_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51201266669_766ac87a35_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Samurai Warriors 3\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Samurai Warriors 3 was the first in the series to add the Spirit Gauge when it first hit Japan back in 2009.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: When you were working on the original SW, what did you think of the graphics? 17 years later, what do you think of the original game\u2019s look now?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A: <\/strong>The visual style for Samurai Warriors used the Dynasty Warriors series as a base, while attempting to develop a design that takes into account Japanese art elements such as ink painting styles. However, I can&#8217;t say we were able to achieve that given the technology available at the time. As we continued the series, the time period each title takes place in slowly moved towards the latter half of the Sengoku period, the visual style became more luxurious to reflect that specific era. In Samurai Warriors 5, we were able to look back on the Japanese art style we were going for in the first entry in the series, and I think we have been able to accomplish that this time, albeit in a different style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51200491976_8bf5a9eee1_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51200491976_8bf5a9eee1_o.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Samurai Warriors 4\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Samurai Warriors 4 debuted in the U.S. on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in October, 2014.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>Q: A character like Nobunaga is featured in every Samurai Warriors game to date. Take us through how his character art and style has changed in each game.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><strong>A:<\/strong> In the original Samurai Warriors, we designed Nobunaga around his Demon King image. We designed him with western style black armor and a cape, along with adding a purple aura to his weapon, in order to give Nobunaga the image of a &#8220;last boss.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Samurai Warriors 2, compared to his design in the previous title, we added gold ornaments to him, along with making his appearance more striking and extravagant. To go along with that, we decorated his shoulders with black feathers to balance out the design. These black feathers also appear during his event scenes, symbolizing this particular image of Nobunaga in this title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For Samurai Warriors 3 we changed the western black armor and cape design we had used for Nobunaga up until this entry in the series by going with a different direction. Specifically we went with a design where Nobunaga is wearing a battle surcoat over his armor. In order to make sure his silhouette wouldn&#8217;t pale in comparison to the other designs in the series, we made sure to add in various changes such as ensuring the shape of his armor was very characteristic in this installment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Samurai Warriors 5\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/felinebreakableconch#?secret=XdpqlwpEMt' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Samurai Warriors 4, we went back to his trademark western armor and cape, along with the most ornate armor in the series&#8217; history.

We at Code Horizon and Discovery are proud to announce that Gold Rush: The Game will be available on PlayStation 4 May 28. This original gold-mining experience is based on Discovery Channel\u2019s #1 show Gold Rush. On launch day, you will get access to all the playable content released so far (including DLC). The objective is: work hard, dig deep, explore the world, to become the wealthiest person in Alaska.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Gold Rush: The Game<em> <\/em>is a realistic gold-mining simulation game. Start with a simple bucket, hog pan, and lease your first claim as you begin to mine gold. You will be able to sit behind the wheels of multiple, highly detailed vehicles (such as bulldozer, drill, front-end loader or excavator) and dig gold on one of four unique mining areas with fully deformable terrain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192026848_fbfdd6a525_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192026848_fbfdd6a525_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Gold Rush: \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Your plan is simple: scout and plan your operation, buy new tiers of mining equipment, and let your gold business grow. But remember \u2013 every real business will face some obstacles. Machines will break, weather will affect your operation and interest on leased property will grow. To make ends meet, you\u2019ll have to embrace the four-season cycle and think about making some extra money. Harsh Alaskan winters impact prices and even decrease durability of your machines. Oh, and don\u2019t be surprised if a bear steals some of your equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192026863_054d9727d8_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192026863_054d9727d8_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Gold Rush: \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Gold Rush: The Game<em> <\/em>is about digging gold by using advanced machinery and taking care of your mining company. Get familiar with the wash plant, gold nuggetator, or wave table. Manage the water pressure and power system to help machines work properly. And don\u2019t forget to hire some workers and let them grow your business!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192878265_5e5da7621b_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51192878265_5e5da7621b_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Gold Rush: \"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">If you are a competitive player, we have a little something for you. Ranked mode (leaderboards) will pit you against other gold prospectors \u2013 who will come on top this time? One season typically lasts about a month in real life, so there\u2019s plenty of time to compete. Each time we add a unique buff or obstacle to make the experience more engaging, such as a discount on a particular claim rental or increased breakdown rate for specific items.

I\u2019m Jeremy Russo, the game director for Knockout City, here to talk to you about the design of Jukebox Junction and some strategies for using the map to your advantage in dominating your opponents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Knockout City\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/chillyhotcrocodile#?secret=9PgpO6jfsW' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">All aboard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The theme for Season 1 is \u201cWelcome to Knockout City,\u201d and what better way to greet new arrivals than a dodgeball to the face as they step off the train? Jukebox Junction is an active, jukebox-themed train station that perfectly showcases our level design philosophy at Velan Studios. Each map is designed to be unique and memorable, by combining a distinctive theme with a fresh gameplay mechanic that opens up new gameplay strategies. Perfectly crafted audio and visuals immediately immerse you in the train station environment, mixed with jukebox-themed details like massive glowing archways and an arrival\/departure schedule made to look like song cards. But the feature to really watch out for (literally) are the trains that come charging through the station!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51190325531_06dd83934c_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51190325531_06dd83934c_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Periodically, massive hover-trains&nbsp; come speeding through the center of Jukebox Junction, temporarily changing the offensive and defensive options available to you in those sections of the map. Getting hit by a train is an instant KO, but because they hover you can ball up and roll under them to make a quick escape or sneak up on opponents. Watch out, though, because there are also bounce pads around that enable players to jump up and glide over the train, or they can even perform a Lob Shot with a ball from the other side if they have a lock on you. One of the most satisfying moves in the game, however, is to tackle an opponent <em>into <\/em>the train, earning your team an easy (and hilarious) point. And if you find yourself back up against a train about to be tackled yourself? Jump at the last second to trick your opponent into diving headfirst into the train themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Each unique map mechanic is meant to provide these types of strategic options. To avoid the possibility of random outcomes, these trains telegraph way ahead of time before they come barreling through with distinctive audio, visual, and rumble cues. Each train line (Red, Yellow, Blue) is also on a set schedule that means they\u2019ll always pass through the station at consistent, reliable times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">See the sights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The layout of Jukebox Junction also demonstrates our approach to designing unique combat spaces with distinct landmarking. Each main location in the map contains a ball, and all spots feature unique geometry to fight around. Due to the high\/wide trajectories that thrown balls can travel along due to our variety of Trick Shots and Ultimate Throws, each combat area features broad shapes in layouts we never repeat, to open up unique 1-on-1 and team-based strategies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51189620122_62ec9ddb47_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51189620122_62ec9ddb47_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Knockout City\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It\u2019s also critical that each of these landmarks feature their own distinct \u201ccallout,\u201d meaning it is uniquely and obviously themed, allowing players to communicate and call out strategies to their team. For example, in Jukebox Junction, you might call out that an opponent is on the roof of the Coffee Bean\u2019d shop, or that you are going to break off and flank the opposing team through the Basement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Now arriving<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Jukebox Junction arrives on the scene with the start of Season 1, permanently integrated into every playlist in the game. This is only the start, however, as several major new features and tons of other content also come along for the ride. Season 1 of League Play also begins on May 25, a competitive ranking system where brawlers will rise (and fall) through the ranks as they win and lose against opposing crews of the same rank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The higher in rank you rise, the better the rewards will be at the end of the Season. Weekly Crew Contracts also begin, and continue throughout all 9 weeks of the Season, offering Crews a sort of \u201csocial battle pass\u201d for free with exclusive Crew-based rewards and major XP boosts for working together to complete tough challenges. Season 1 Contracts also become available to all players to complete on their own, along with new cosmetic items every day in the Brawl Shop and a new playlist almost every single week, giving you and your friends a massive variety of experiences throughout the Season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51190542733_5043510ace_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51190542733_5043510ace_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Whether you bought your ticket or hopped the holo-turnstile, Season 1 is the perfect opportunity to see how much each season of Knockout City adds to the game. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.playstation.com\/games\/knockout-city\/\">Knockout City arrives May 21 on PlayStation 4<\/a>, and PlayStation 5 through backwards compatibility, so Crew Up, hop aboard, and get to dodgebrawling!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the upcoming release of Season 1 for Knockout City on May 25, now is the perfect time for a deep-dive into a new map coming your way: Jukebox Junction.

The risk-reward mechanic here is that the more you use Evan\u2019s various abilities, the more his implants begin to overheat. If you allow this to happen, Evan is completely vulnerable for a brief period whilst the implants cool down. To help visualize this, the light on the DualSense controller will change to match the heat level of Evan\u2019s implants, giving you a constant visual to keep you in the moment during a fight.

She lacks all but the most basic knowledge of what is happening and what she has gotten herself into, and she is completely unequipped to overcome the obstacles in her path \u2013 two problems she will have to solve on the go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">For Reina\u2019s design we had the good fortune of working with Leandro Franci, a fantastic illustrator with a knack for the stylized aesthetic we wanted to achieve, and Dan Eder, a master of stylized 3D modelling who was able to bring Leandro\u2019s sketches to life. Reina\u2019s scars tell of her difficult life and her simple clothes speak to her working-class status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"reina-drone-fight\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/respectfulunselfishiberianbarbel#?secret=NzkdkXEZvj' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Around her neck rests a powerful artifact called the Regret Device which allows her to revisit the recent past armed with knowledge and items she has gained along the way \u2013 an imperfect form of time travel that makes events play out slightly differently each time she uses it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Non-Linear Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"reina-regret-device\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/wideeyedgreedykilldeer#?secret=72ib4jtJOy' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">A key hallmark of the 2D action-exploration genre is backtracking: the player will see a locked door or other obstacle blocking off exploration to some area, and later they will find the key to surmounting it and come back later to explore. In Reina &amp; Jericho we wanted to push this idea further in two ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The player can backtrack through time and causality, rather than just geographically.<\/li><li>We integrate the story into this exploration and revisitation as much as possible.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188243388_5c125c67c2_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188243388_010a7097d6_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Reina &amp;amp; Jericho\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The Regret Device allows Reina to quick travel to previous game locations, but also undoes all the events that have taken place <em>after<\/em> that moment.&nbsp; Sometimes the implications of this are minor: a shorter path to power ups that were once out of reach. Other times they are crucial \u2013 people who were killed after the moment Reina has returned will be alive again, although perhaps missing a few items she has taken from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Integrated Story<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">I have long felt the exploratory nature of the 2D action-exploration genre had the potential for cool storytelling that could only be done through the medium of video games but was often relegated to a secondary role.&nbsp; I would often think about the similarities between backtracking in a Metroidvania and the way the mind constantly travels back to moments of regret and previous decisions that could have been made differently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"reina-talking\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/perfumedexemplaryirishwolfhound#?secret=uuMOfeGggJ' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">With Reina &amp; Jericho we have woven a powerful story about love, suffering, regret, and consequence that will follow Reina as she is gradually pulled deeper into the machinations of the villain, Eli Faust.&nbsp; Reina\u2019s attempt to rescue Jericho becomes more and more entangled with the broader events of the story \u2013 past, present, and future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Emotive Music<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Vanessa naturally gravitates towards an emotional, heavy style of music.&nbsp; Our process for making the soundtrack was relatively straight forward: Vanessa would sit down at a piano and play improvisationally for somewhere between two minutes and two hours, and I would record everything so I could sift through it later and give her a shortlist of material to formally compose from. Sometimes we would listen to music beforehand to get in a mood \u2013 usually something from Nobuo Uematsu, Arcade Fire, Bear McCreary, or Yoko Shimomura \u2013 other times it would be conversations about what was happening in the story, but it always started with those sessions of exploring music on the piano.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Gameplay<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"reina-inquisitor-fight\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/incompatibleimperfectant#?secret=fmbD52Tj72' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Reina has a simple core set of moves that offers a solid foundation for newcomers to the genre while still leaving room for expressive and highly skilled play thanks to all the ways Reina\u2019s different actions can be strung together and interconnected.&nbsp; The critical path through the game contains a good mix of exploration, combat, and platforming, but side paths that grant minor power ups are where we put the more explicit challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187323412_1f0b3119dc_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187323412_a06d20d77a_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Reina &amp;amp; Jericho\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Stay tuned for the release announcement for Reina &amp; Jericho.

We\u2019re thrilled for players of all ages to be able to jump into Bomberman for fun battles online with friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Before you blast off, we wanted to pass on a few tips and tricks straight from the game\u2019s development team. Bomberman battles are quick and easy to pick up and play, but the game has hidden tricks and some surprising character and power-up abilities. To get a head start and increase your odds of becoming Bomber One, check out the following tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188150288_318a583987_h.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188150288_318a583987_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Super Bomberman R Online\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>1. Safety first<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">A bomb exploding will trigger other close-by bombs to go off immediately and can cause chain reactions. If you try to place bombs in a row you could end up getting blasted by your own bombs, so focus on controlling and predicting the areas of explosion at first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>2. Clever bomb placement<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Some soft blocks have power-ups hidden inside them, so use your bombs to release them.&nbsp; Be careful though, you can trap yourself between a block and your own bomb. You can destroy up to three brown soft blocks with one bomb though, so keep that in mind and place your bombs in the best spots possible instead of placing too many.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<p class=\"\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>3. Keep calm and blast on<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The game may feel fast-paced at the beginning, but stay calm. You can avoid other players and their bombs early on and focus on finding power-ups and getting used to the flow of the action. Do you need a break from the heat? Look out for Green Louie eggs to pick up: they hatch a trusty and speedy ally for you to ride on, assisting and protecting your Bomber.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-33.33% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(100.00% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Louie-Assist-1-1\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/legalastonishingdiplodocus#?secret=6QvjZva6Ov' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-33.33% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(100.00% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Aqua-Pierce-Bomb-Trap-1-1\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/fatalperkydobermanpinscher#?secret=SgjIiM1357' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\">\n<p class=\"\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>4. Piercing action<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The special Pierce Bombs have a large radius. It\u2019s great for finding other power-ups or surprising enemies who think they\u2019re safe. If you\u2019re in a rush, Aqua is a great character to learn with because she starts with Pierce Bomb equipped. That can be a big advantage while you are learning to play and trying to grab a lot of power-ups. Aqua will make you a force to be reckoned with: because Pierce Bombs are very powerful, they\u2019re extremely dangerous in the final stage once the area begins to shrink.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>5. Too many is not enough<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You do have an upper limit on how many power-ups you can hold, and that will vary per Bomber. So pick your Bomber carefully after checking if their abilities match with your play style, but don\u2019t stop grabbing power-ups. If you grab a power-up and your Bomber isn\u2019t able to use it,&nbsp; it gets destroyed so your enemies can\u2019t use it against you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>6. Strategic power-ups<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Prioritize grabbing the Bomb Kick and Bomb Punch power-ups as soon as you can. They are more versatile than other power-ups and can be used for attack or defense. The Bomb Kick will shove bombs away from you until they hit another object. The Bomb Punch will launch bombs over obstacles three squares away and can even be used at the map edge to wrap a bomb around to the other side. Practice makes perfect to make good use of the lesser-known tricks you can pull off with those abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.73% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.20% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Bomb Punch Knockout 16-9\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/plumplazycapybara#?secret=rtP2S8OrsO' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Now that you\u2019re ready, let\u2019s see how you can hold your own in a quick Battle 64.

It\u2019s a murder mystery with a time travel twist. You\u2019re trapped on an island locked in an infinite time loop, with you and its denizens forced to repeat the same day over and over. The only way out is to track down eight targets, found somewhere in the four districts that divide the island. Assassinating all before one loop ends breaks it for good. But while you see the loop as a curse to be lifted, your intended kills see it as an endless, consequence-free party. As such they, and nearly everyone else on the island, will attempt to kill you on sight. And that includes your worst enemy and equal, who can be controlled by another player online. They have a single goal: protect the loop by ending you before you end it. Die, and your day starts again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">The original concept, created while Arkane was working with MachineGames on 2019\u2019s Wolfenstein: Youngblood, would offer a diverse tool set, player freedom to experiment, and an architecturally coherent, intricate world to explore. A continued adherence to the defining principles of the studio\u2019s previous works. The focus however, would be on replayability. The studio soon found itself eager to include \u201ca big story\u201d, character development, a rich world, an adventure arc &#8211; all also defining characteristics of its past games. \u201cHow could we build familiarity in a very focused, intimate space?\u201d asks creative director Dinga Bakaba rhetorically. The solution: break time. The 60\u2019s-style setting and \u201cthe impossible task\u201d &#8211; eight assassinations in a single day &#8211; crystalised soon after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Time to kill<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Colt starts the day equipped with little more than \u201ca cool jacket, a horrible hangover and a rusty SMG.\u201d The rules of the loop and your place in it are quickly and violently explained. A better arsenal, including traditional weaponry (that\u2019s customisable) and unique powers, need to be recovered as you explore the island from those you\u2019ve bested in firefights or caught unawares. Discovery of two loopholes make your death less severe. One will allow you to carry over certain things between loops. The second is Deathloop\u2019s own spin on respawns. Reprises give you three chances per loop to continue, and by finding your previous downed self you recover all items collected up to their (your?) untimely death.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187598651_02f380cfb1_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187598651_02f380cfb1_o.png\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Deathloop\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>\u201cHe is, I think, perpetually funny, surprising, charming,\u201d says Bakaba of Deathloop\u2019s protagonist Colt. \u201cI think this is a guy who copes with those tragic events with self-deprecation and \u2018dad\u2019 jokes. He has flair, is very confident. He can just throw out these jokes, approach the situation with a lot of confidence.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Colt\u2019s nimble. Necessary when the world\u2019s out to kill you and you\u2019ve spaces to explore. Blackreef\u2019s world design clearly shows Arkane\u2019s continued love of verticality and, by association, powers that tap into superhuman exploration (\u201cIt\u2019s really important to us,\u201d says Art Director Sebastien Mitton. \u201cWithout powers, I always feel like I\u2019m stuck on the ground. I\u2019m frustrated\u201d). As a result, each district is a dense sprawl. \u201cImagine a level like Dishonored 2\u2018s Edge of the World, and made even bigger, that\u2019d give you an idea,\u201d explains Bakaba of the expected scale for each.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Deathloop NimbleColt 16x9 Unrated\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/bestenchantedcrossbill#?secret=NsR5dm10n6' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-default-font\">It\u2019s also worth noting that while the game day doesn\u2019t play out in real time, there are four distinct time periods across the 24-hour day. There are different stories and activities playing out in each district for every time period, while what areas you can access and your routes through them can alter. The location of your targets, the Visionaries, also vary depending on the time of day you visit.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">While a quick menu selection can freely switch you between times, actions in one time period can have repercussions in another. The studio is cagey about story details, but offers one eventuality to illustrate: a character saved earlier in the day will unlock a door somewhere else later, giving you access to a new part of the island.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-default-font\">\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">From soldier to assassin&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">In Deathloop, frontal assaults are possible yet not advised. Mapping out areas and enemy positions first allows you to plan out attacks or routes that increase your survival chances. Simultaneously you could (and should) eavesdrop on important conversations and discover hidden spots that\u2019ll help your objectives. As example: if everyone is wearing a mask, how do you pinpoint your target? Or another: can you take out a target without alerting anyone?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"ps-age-gate-container\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ps-age-gate-container__inner\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.75% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.25% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"Deathloop Aggressive 16x9 Unrated\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/skeletalidioticblackwidowspider#?secret=bPZWnKFcPX' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ps-age-gate-container__overlay\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ps-age-gate-container__overlay-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"ps-age-gate-container__unlock-button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--lock icon--white\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" focusable=\"false\" version=\"1.1\">\n\t\t<title>Verify your age to view this content.<\/title><path fill=\"none\" d=\"M0 0H20V20H0z\"><\/path><path class=\"icon-primary-color\" d=\"M15 9h-1V6c0-2.2-1.8-4-4-4S6 3.8 6 6v3H5c-.5 0-1 .5-1 1v7c0 .5.5 1 1 1h10c.5 0 1-.5 1-1v-7c0-.5-.5-1-1-1zm-4 7H9l.4-2.2c-.5-.2-.9-.8-.9-1.3 0-.8.7-1.5 1.5-1.5s1.5.7 1.5 1.5c0 .6-.3 1.1-.9 1.3L11 16zm1-7H8V6c0-1.1.9-2 2-2s2 .9 2 2v3z\"><\/path>\t<\/svg>\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Verify your age to view this content.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Aggressive measures do come into play as well. Alongside a tool to hack tech like turrets, collectable Trinkets grant weapon upgrades and customisations. Slabs are items of power, each of which grant a unique ability. Not all are traversal-based: Kinesis is the obvious early headliner, letting you toss enemies into the air or against walls (or each other) with a wave of your hand. Find which works best for your playstyle: your loadout is limited to three weapons and two powers, the latter of which can have two upgrades. (Upgradable by assassinating the same target on a subsequent loop).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188733055_bed6cdbefa_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188733055_bed6cdbefa_o.png\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Deathloop\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Deathloop was an early example of what was possible with the DualSense wireless controller. Bakaba explains every weapon will have a slightly different feel. \u201cYou mentioned the trigger locking to represent your gun jamming. But when you\u2019re out of ammo, the trigger effect will disappear. Even before your brain registers it, the animation, the click-click sound, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re out.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">It\u2019s all about having fun with the toolbox, combining and seeing what results. \u201cBy the end of the game you\u2019re kind of a demigod,\u201d says Bakaba. And player choice is key. If you really want to, you can try and complete the game with \u201cjust that rusty SMG and whatever you find on your way and accept you will lose everything at the end of each loop. It\u2019s entirely up to you as a player.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">But not all things are in your control. Enter Julianna.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Meet your worst enemy&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Julianna began life as one of your targets. Even early in development, she was distinct. While her fellows would be self-involved and let others do their dirty work, Julianna was driven, actively trying to take you out first. It turned one of Blackreef\u2019s elite &#8211; its Visionaries &#8211;&nbsp; into your equal and would challenge you to outfox her. That drive is still core to her character. But she only became fully realised, and ultimately co-lead on the game\u2019s cover art, when someone within the studio suggested she could be a playable character.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say a eureka moment,\u201d responds Bakaba when I ask him and Mitton if that idea changed the trajectory of what the game could be. \u201cIt was a crossroad. It\u2019s not just adding an enemy type [&#8230;] it was definitely a turning point.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">One initial concern was the technical impact of a second, player-controlled character in the world. Multiplayer could mean compromising on Arkane\u2019s vision of Blackreef\u2019s NPC density or the scale of the island\u2019s level design. Fears were put to rest once the studio learned about the speed of PS5\u2019s CPU. \u201cIt gave us oxygen,\u201d says Mitton simply.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51186900267_e607c2654d_o.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51186900267_e607c2654d_o.png\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Deathloop\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Even without player control, Julianna is a constant presence. She continually harasses Colt, either from afar, haranguing him through the world\u2019s multitude of tannoys and speaker systems, or up close even as she attempts to kill him. To be fair, Colt quickly starts giving back as good as he gets, energetic verbal clashes that, as Bakaaba puts it, are a \u201ccontest of punchlines\u201d and ones he\u2019s eager to see players react to.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Those barbs are surprisingly good-natured in their delivery. Attempted murderer she may be, there\u2019s no vindictiveness or vengefulness to Julianna. She\u2019s playful. For someone trying to kill me, she\u2019s incredibly likeable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh island,\u201d Bakaba responds when I ask him about the contradiction of someone I want to know better yet maintain a safe distance from. \u201cPeople came here for an eternal party.

We also released the AllStar Pass* which has brought loads of new cosmetics to the game for players to personalise their favourite AllStars. It\u2019s been great seeing the community getting to grips with Alba and her Hero Vehicle, as well as starting their seasonal challenges to earn bonus progress on the AllStar Pass. However, this is just the beginning of Season One and we\u2019ve got a roadmap packed full of updates that will be rolling out over the next few months!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188830120_7e9339fc99_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188830120_5a4cbe1f24_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Destruction AllStars\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\">Photo Mode<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Today, we\u2019re launching Photo Mode in Destruction AllStars for all single-player content! Having made sure that we delivered next generation destruction physics and characters whose personality came through with every action they take, it was only natural that we wanted to give you the tools to capture some of their most spectacular moments from the coolest angles they could find.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188539464_a9eff13c9a_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51188539464_6dbd0291ff_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Destruction AllStars\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">At any point in a single-player game, you can pause the match and enter Photo Mode which will put you in a free camera around your AllStar. The controls are intuitive to use: you can move around the arena, move the camera up or down as well as picking that perfect angle with the analog sticks and adaptive triggers. To help you find the shot that works, you have the option to hide other objects in the frame such as other AllStars, nameplates, vehicles or certain visual effects so you can focus on the action without something getting in the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187985363_ca6f402d5a_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187985363_12d85e7174_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Destruction AllStars\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Once you\u2019ve found your shot, you can tinker with more advanced features such as exposure, gamma, contrast or saturation. You can even apply a wide variety of filters to truly make the colours pop or find the stylised effect that really works for you! There\u2019s actually a great deal of depth to our Photo Mode with loads of different settings and features for you to explore, such as focus, aperture, arena lighting and plenty more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187766411_eee304291e_k.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51187766411_ecc80aa4a5_h.jpg\" aria-hidden=\"true\" alt=\"Destruction AllStars\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><br>As a final step, you can choose to add a frame to your photo along with a huge array of stickers to add that finishing touch. We\u2019ve got frames and stickers inspired by all of our 17 AllStars as well as a whole host of other options to choose from. Using the social features built directly into the PS5 console, you can share your images straight to social media! We\u2019d love to see what you can create with this amazing new feature so be sure to tag your creations with the official Destruction AllStars Twitter account @PlayDestruction!

Have no fear, Bend Studio has you covered with some developer insights to help you get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Drifter Bike<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">You must maintain your bike by scavenging for scrap, searching for fuel, and upgrading it at encampments. Early on, you want to invest in your bike as much as possible. Whether you need to flee from an unexpected horde, chase down a bounty or escape an ambush, your bike is crucial for survival. To help limit maintenance with your bike, focus on upgrading your fuel tank to ride longer distances before having to stop. If you run out of fuel, you will need to walk your bike and explore the Freaker infested land by foot. Take good care of it, and it will take care of you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Tip: Look out for tow trucks and believe it or not gas stations for fuel.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Hordes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Hordes are a formidable foe in Days Gone. They can range from 25 Freakers to 500 Freakers. To take down a horde, you need to strategize, come prepared with ammo, traps and plan an escape route. It will not be easy, but to increase your chances at succeeding follow these couple of tips to begin your path at creating a safer world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Tip 1: Force the Freakers down narrow pathways to jumble them up creating a better line of fire. Use attractors to throw at nearby flammable crates and barrels to lure a group of them to that spot, then blow it up.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Tip 2: Park your bike close in case you need to run back to it to fill up your ammo from your saddlebags (can be equipped as an upgrade).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/2kYptB5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51177775350_94c091d247_h.jpg\" alt=\"Days Gone (PC)\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>NERO Locations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Keep your eye out during your travels for NERO locations. NERO checkpoints have valuable items for you to upgrade Deacon, gather crafting supplies, access your gun locker and fuel to top off your tank. You can find NERO injectors at these locations to upgrade your Stamina, Focus or Health. Each upgrade provides a significant boost and can be the difference between life and death.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Tip: Upgrade your Stamina first&#8230; You can always run away if you are not prepared.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/2kYptAo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51177775310_f4d95698e2_h.jpg\" alt=\"Days Gone (PC)\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Encampments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Each encampment uses the trust and credits system, but what you get at each one differs. Complete jobs, clear infestation zones, hand in bounties and eliminate hordes to increase your trust levels with encampments and earn credits to buy weapons and bike upgrades. A couple camps you will run into early on are Copeland\u2019s Camp and Hot Springs. Copeland\u2019s Camp includes a Mechanic that will upgrade your bike to improve performance and give you customizations options that include decals, paints, bike skins and visual parts. Hot Springs specializes in selling weapons to help you fight the relentless danger outside of the gates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Infestation Zones<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Speaking of infestation zones, you want to burn out these nests as fast as possible. Make sure you have enough molotovs crafted or use the incendiary bolts with your crossbow to set the nests ablaze. Freakers use these nests to hibernate during the day, giving you a slight edge on their whereabouts. Be aware, if you are brave enough to tackle these zones at night, you will have more Freakers roaming around the wilderness. By successfully clearing out an infestation zone, you will be awarded with a new fast travel route to move around the map more efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\"><em>Tip: The day\/night cycle and weather changes the behavior of the Freakers.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/2kYiTx9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/51176685186_9ee90a1cb5_h.jpg\" alt=\"Days Gone (PC)\"><\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"\"><strong>Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Days Gone provides three skill trees including melee combat, ranged combat and survival to invest your skill points in. Each player has their own unique playstyle, but we recommend unlocking these skills first to help you during the initial stages of the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Ranged: Focused Shot. This skill gives you the ability to activate Focus while aiming a ranged weapon. Focus slows down time and helps to increase accuracy, which is beneficial when going up against a horde. You can upgrade this ability with the NERO injectors found across the map.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Ranged: Fight And Flight. This skill helps you to move and aim a ranged weapon with more precision. Days Gone will keep you on your toes and the Freakers will not allow you to stay stationary. Get used to running!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Melee: Field Repairs. This skill gives you the ability to repair melee weapons with scrap.

Playing the King of Darkness, you must put your skills &#8211; such as teleportation and dashing &#8211;&nbsp; to the test to unlock all the world\u2019s secrets and discover its many alternative routes. You can improve your abilities through a huge skill tree, choosing between three different paths: ranged, melee and magic. Allowing you to personalize your playstyle and use six unique weapons and powerful skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.76% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.27% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"aeterna noctis 02\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/terriblecourteousgaur#?secret=5fOXMia2xN' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Aeterna Noctis features 16 large and visually distinct areas, populated with over 100 different enemies; a roster of fantasy creatures, monsters and warriors that will put reflexes to the test! Then there are 20 legendary bosses, each of which promise a true challenge.

You can discover NPCs who are pocketed throughout the areas and who will unlock secondary missions. Not only are those quests designed to test you, they\u2019ve been designed to add to the game\u2019s lore, enriching the story of the King of Darkness\u2019 journey to regain the power of Aeterna. Even if you focus solely on the main adventure, you\u2019re looking at around 20 hours of playtime, backed by a haunting, 46-track score.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-gfycat wp-block-embed-gfycat\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\" style=\"margin-bottom: calc(-18.76% - 10px)\">\n<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.27% + 44px)'><iframe title=\"aeterna noctis 01\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/belovedacidicintermediateegret#?secret=n1mzv64RLP' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">Aeterna Noctis has the support of PlayStation Talents initiative and will be available on PS5 and PS4 December 15 this year, and will be fully localized &#8211; voiceovers and text &#8211; into eight different languages.
